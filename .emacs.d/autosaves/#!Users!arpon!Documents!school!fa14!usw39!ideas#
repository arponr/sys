- maybe the main question is: how has the role of the leader changed?

- H.K. protests fairly leaderless
  - similar to occupy movement, is this a modern phenomenon: people
    can coordinate via technology (arab protests also do this i think)
  - what might this say about direct vs. representative democracy in
    contemporary times?

- R.I. ends up with Dorr as leader

- similarities between H.K. and R.I.
  - basic: people concerned about fair representation in government
  - R.I. also grass roots to some extent (R.I. Suffrage Assoc.)
  - movement is peaceful and organised, illustrated by the drafting of
    the constitution in R.I., the cleanliness of H.K. protests
