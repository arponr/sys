Beauty and Art
==============

Lying on the shore, reading *Kafka on the Shore*, how could I *not*
think about beauty and art? This time, though, I managed to think some
thoughts I think are actually worth writing down---for myself, at
least.

Before I begin, a disclaimer about what I mean when I say "art". I'm
really thinking of literature, since that's what set this train of
thought in motion. But I'm using the word "art" instead, because I
suspect/hope that what I'm saying applies more generally, e.g. to the
visual arts.

Beautiful and interesting things
--------------------------------

I'm an introverted math student, so my social group is, let's say,
compact. In particular, art hasn't been the subject of very many of my
recent conversations. But when it has, a number of times the main
question has been something like "what's the point of it?" or "what
does it accomplish?"

As someone who really enjoys fiction---reading and watching, though
more so the latter as of late (t.v. is, somewhat regrettably, rather
addicting)---I believe in the importance of art. My justification for
it has always been a simple one, the same justification I give for
doing math: it's interesting, or beautiful, and that's enough. I.e.,
I've always been convinced that one shouldn't need any more reason to
do something than that it's interesting. Or more reason to make
something than that it's beautiful.

My feelings about this have evolved a bit.
