\section{The problem}

To start at the very beginning, we state the basic definitions.

\begin{notation}
  \label{ints}
  Throughout we have integers $n \ge 2$ and $0 \le k \le n$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definitions}
  \label{vfield-dfn}
  Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. Let $\pi \c T \to M$ be the
  tangent bundle on $M$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{vector field} on $M$ is a continuous section $v \c M
    \to T$ of $\pi$.
  \item A set of vector fields $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$ on $M$ is
    \emph{linearly independent} if for each $p \in M$ the vectors
    $v_1(p),\ldots,v_k(p)$ are linearly independent in the tangent
    space $T_p$. In particular a single vector field $v$ forms a
    linearly independent set if and only if it is nowhere vanishing.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

Now the actual story: we are taught to love spheres from our very
first days in the land of topology. But perhaps it is the following
result---or perhaps really its title---which first truly beguiles us.

\begin{theorem}[Hairy ball]
  \label{hairy-ball}
  The sphere $\S^{n-1}$ admits a nowhere vanishing vector field if and
  only if $n$ is even.
\end{theorem}

Of course, so enticed, we cannot just leave it there. We must ask the
following.

\begin{question}
  \label{vfield-prob}
  Then how many vector fields does $\S^{n-1}$ admit? Or more
  precisely, what is the maximum size of a set of linearly independent
  vector fields on $\S^{n-1}$?
\end{question}

This is one of those questions that occupied people for a while. Its
answer was one of the first applications of generalised cohomology
theory, and involves some really nice ideas, some of which are
hopefully conveyed in this exposition.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Lower bound}

We first briefly review the positive side of the problem, that is, how
to actually construct some vector fields and achieve a lower bound. We
do this for completeness, and because it clarifies the sort of numbers
we see in the upper bound. One can see, e.g., \cite{hopkins-256y,
  miller-vfields} for more details.

\newcommand{\Cl}{\mathrm{Cl}}
\newcommand{\HH}{\mathbb{H}}
\begin{definition}
  \label{clifford}
  The \emph{Clifford algebras} $\Cl_l$ for $l \ge 0$ are the free
  associative $\R$-algebras with generators $e_1,\ldots,e_l$ subject
  to the relations $e_i^2 = -1$ and $e_ie_j = -e_je_i$ for $i \ne
  j$. For small values of $l$ these are as follows, where $A(d)$
  denotes the algebra of $d$-by-$d$ matrices in $A$.
  \[
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      $l$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
      \hline
      $\Cl_l$ & $\R$ & $\C$ & $\HH$ & $\HH^{\oplus 2}$ & $\HH(2)$ &
      $\C(4)$ & $\R(8)$ & $\R(8)^{\oplus 2}$ & $\R(16)$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \]
  For large values of $l$ we have a periodicity $\Cl_{l+8} \simeq 
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  \label{radon-hurwitz}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Write $n = 2^ab$ with $b$ odd, and write $a = 4c + d$ with $0
    \le d \le 3$. We define $\rho(n) \ce 2^d + 8c$.\footnote{The
      $\rho(n)$ are called the \emph{Radon-Hurwitz numbers}.} Note in
    particular $\rho(n) = 1$ if $n$ is odd.
  \item Define $e_k \ce |\{0 < j \le k : j \equiv 0,1,2,4 \pmod
    8\}|$. It's easy to see that
    \begin{equation}
      \label{radon-max}
      \rho(n) - 1 = \max \{l \ge 0 : 2^{e_l} \mid n\} = \max \{l
      \ge 0 : e_l \le a\}.
  \end{equation}
  \end{itemize}
\end{notation}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{vfield-lower-bound}
  There exists a set of $\rho(n)-1$ linearly independent vector fields
  on $\S^{n-1}$.
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Upper bound: a reduction}

Getting an upper bound is where the real difficulty lies. Well, we
know one upper bound: $\S^{n-1}$ certainly can't admit $n$ linearly
independent vector fields, since $\dim \S^{n-1} = n - 1$. And to say
$\S^{n-1}$ admits $n-1$ linearly independent vector fields is to say
$\S^{n-1}$ is parallelisable, which famously is true if and only if $n
\in \{2,4,8\}$. An optimal upper bound would at least tell us this
parallelisability result. So let's think about it for a second and
reduce the question to one more attackable by algebra.

\begin{nothing}
  \label{gram-schmidt}
  First of all, we have our very nice embedding $\S^{n-1} \inj \R^n$,
  which gives the tangent spaces of $\S^{n-1}$ a very concrete
  description. In particular, a vector field on $\S^{n-1}$ is just a
  map $v \c \S^{n-1} \to \R^n$ such that $v(x) \perp x$ (in $\R^n$)
  for all $x \in \S^{n-1}$. Now, by Gram-Schmidt, giving $k$ linearly
  independent vector fields $v_1,\ldots,v_k \c \S^{n-1} \to \R^n$ is
  equivalent to giving $k$ (pointwise) orthonormal vector fields. This
  leads us to recall the following definition.
\end{nothing}

\begin{definition}
  \label{stiefel}
  For $l \in \N$, the \emph{Stiefel manifold} $\V_{l,n}$ is the space
  \[
  \{(v_1,\ldots,v_l) : v_i \in \S^{n-1}, \langle v_i, v_j \rangle =
  \delta_{i,j}\}
  \]
  of orthonormal $l$-frames on $\R^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{section-reduction}
  Let $\pi_k \c \V_{k+1,n} \to \S^{n-1}$ be the projection
  $(v_1,\ldots,v_{k+1}) \mapsto v_1$. Then $\S^{n-1}$ admits a set of
  $k$ linearly independent vector fields if and only if there is a
  section $\S^{n-1} \to \V_{k+1,n}$ of $\pi_k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This is immediate from the discussion in \pref{gram-schmidt}.
\end{proof}

So we've reduced our problem to the existence of some map. Already one
can imagine using algebra to get at the problem now. E.g., for what
$k$ can this map exist in singular homology or cohomology?  This was
the strategy of Steenrod and Whitehead \cite{steenrod-vfields}, who
achieve an upper bound $k \le 2^a$, in the notation of
\pref{radon-hurwitz}. Of course this result doesn't tell us that
$\S^{15}$ is not parallelisable, and leaves a large gap from the lower
bound \pref{vfield-lower-bound}. This gap was finally closed by Adams,
who ingeniously employed K-theory instead to show the lower bound
\pref{vfield-lower-bound} is in fact optimal.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{adams-vfields}]
  \label{vfield-upper-bound}
  There does not exist a set of $\rho(n)$ linearly independent vector
  fields on $\S^{n-1}$.
\end{theorem}

Our goal for the remainder is to explain the ideas behind a proof of
this theorem, which of course completely answers our question
\pref{vfield-prob}. Following \cite{miller-vfields}, the argument we
give is not in the original form presented in \cite{adams-vfields},
but rather one utilising Adams's later work on bounding the image of
the J-homomorphism \cite{adams-J-II}.

However, we will only work in complex K-theory. As a result we will
achieve a very slightly worse upper bound than promised by
\pref{vfield-upper-bound}, but this way we get to avoid a few
subtleties that arise in studying real K-theory. At least to the
author, it seems the argument in complex K-theory retains the main
ideas and yet is much easier to absorb. At the end we will explain
why, after sorting out the subtleties, translating the argument into
real K-theory gives the full result.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Connection to the J-homomorphism}

We first review our basic notation and the general setup of Adams's
study of the J-homomorphism.

\begin{notation}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item For the remainder, $X$ will denote a connected finite
    CW-complex.
  \item Denote\footnote{We use Adams's notation for K-theory rather
      than the what is the standard notation these days, since it
      seems more convenient for our purposes.} real and complex
    K-theory by $\K_\Lambda(X)$ with $\Lambda = \R$ or $\Lambda = \C$,
    respectively, and reduced K-theory by $\wt\K_\Lambda(X)$.
  \item We have maps:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\iota \c \K_\C(X) \to \K_\R(X)$ by forgetting complex
      structure;
    \item $\kappa \c \K_\R(X) \to \K_\C(X)$ by complexification, i.e.,
      tensoring with $X \times \C$.
    \end{itemize}
    Note that since $\C \simeq \R \oplus \R$ the map $\iota \circ
    \kappa$ is just multiplication by $2$.
  \item If $\xi \to X$ is a real or complex vector bundle, we
    abusively denote its class in $\K_\Lambda(X)$ by $\xi$ as well.
  \item Let $\epsilon_\Lambda$ for $\Lambda = \R$ or $\Lambda = \C$
    denote the trivial real or complex line bundle (over a space
    understood from context), respectively.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}

\begin{remark}
  \label{dimension-welldefined}
  Since we always work over a connected base, any vector bundle $\xi
  \to X$ has a well-defined dimension over a specified $\Lambda$, and
  this extends to a ring morphism $\dim \c \K_\Lambda(X) \to \Z$. Recall
  $\wt\K_\Lambda(X) = \ker(\dim)$.
\end{remark}

\newcommand{\SF}{\mathrm{SF}}
\begin{definitions}
  \label{J-dfns}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item A \emph{spherical fibration} over $X$ is a fibre bundle $S \to
    X$ whose fibre has the homotopy type of a sphere.
  \item Let $S \to X$ and $S' \to X$ be two spaces over $X$. We say
    $S$ and $S'$ are \emph{fibre homotopy equivalent} if there are
    maps $f \c S \to S'$ and $g \c S' \to S$ over $X$ and homotopies
    $gf \simeq \id_S$ and $fg \simeq \id_{S'}$ over $X$.\footnote{As
      usual, ``over $X$'' just means preserving fibres.}
  \item Denote by $\SF(X)$ the Grothendieck group of the monoid of
    fibre homotopy equivalence classes of spherical fibrations over
    $X$ with fibre-wise smash product.
  \item The \emph{(real) J-homomorphism} is the map $\J_\R \c \K_\R(X)
    \to \SF(X)$ induced by $\xi \mapsto \xi-0$ for bundles $\xi \to
    X$, i.e., removing the zero section. Or if we equip $\xi$ with a
    metric, then the \emph{unit sphere bundle} $S(\xi) \ce \{v \in \xi
    : |v| = 1\}$ is evidently fibre homotopy equivalent to $\xi-0$, so
    we have $\J(\xi) = S(\xi)$.
  \item We get a \emph{complex J-homomorphism} $\J_\C \ce \J_\R \circ
    \iota \c \K_\C(X) \to \K_\R(X) \to \SF(X)$.
  \item The \emph{image of the J-homomorphism} is denoted
    $\J_\Lambda(X)$ with $\Lambda = \R$ or $\Lambda = \C$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

We now show how to relate our problem to a question about the
J-homomorphism.

\begin{lemma}[Dold-Lashof]
  \label{dold-fibre}
  Let $Y \to X$ and $Y' \to X$ be fibre bundles. Assume $Y$ and $Y'$
  have the homotopy type of CW-complexes and $X$ is connected. Then a
  map $Y \to Y'$ over $X$ inducing a homotopy equivalence on all
  fibres is in fact a fibre homotopy equivalence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{notation}
  \label{bundle-notation}
  Let $\gamma$ denote the tautological real line bundle over $\RP^k$.
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{RP-reduction}
  Assume $\pi_k \c \V_{k+1,n} \to \S^{n-1}$ has a section. Then there
  is a fibre homotopy equivalence $S(\epsilon_\R^{\oplus n}) \to
  S(\gamma^{\oplus n})$ over $\RP^k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  First let $Y \ce (\S^k \times \S^{n-1})/(\Z/2)$, with $\Z/2$ acting
  diagonally via the antipodal maps, and observe there is a
  homeomorphism $Y \simeq S(\gamma^{\oplus n})$ over $\RP^k$, where the
  map $Y \to \RP^k$ is induced by projection
  \[
  \S^k \times \S^{n-1} \to \S^k \to \RP^k, \quad (v,x) \mapsto \ell_v.
  \]
  Indeed, viewing $S(\gamma^{\oplus n}) \subset \gamma^{\oplus n}
  \subset \RP^k \times (\R^{k+1})^n$, the homeomorphism is induced by
  \[
  \S^k \times \S^{n-1} \to \RP^k \times (\R^{k+1})^n, \quad (v,x)
  \mapsto (\ell_v, x_1v, \ldots, x_nv),
  \]
  where $(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ce x \in \S^{n-1} \subset \R^n$. Then since
  $S(\epsilon_\R^{\oplus n}) \simeq \RP^k \times \S^{n-1}$, we are
  left to give a fibre homotopy equivalence $\RP^k \times \S^{n-1} \to
  Y$.

  If $s \c \S^{n-1} \to \V_{k+1,n}$ is a section of $\pi_k$ then we
  get a map $f \c \RP^k \times \S^{n-1} \to Y$ over $\RP^k$ induced by
  the map
  \[
  \S^k \times \S^{n-1} \to \S^k \times \S^{n-1}, \quad (v,x) \mapsto
  (v, s(x)v),
  \]
  where $s(x) \in \V_{k+1,n}$ acts on $\S^k$ by identifying an
  orthonormal frame with an $n$-by-$(k+1)$ matrix. Note that since $s$
  is a section, if $e_1 \in \S^k$ is the first canonical basis vector,
  then $s(x)e_1 = x$.

  Since $f$ preserves fibres, over each $\ell \in \RP^k$ it induces a
  map $f_\ell \c \S^{n-1} \to \S^{n-1}$. On any connected open set $U
  \subseteq \RP^k$ over which $\gamma^{\oplus n}$ is trivial, the
  assignment $\ell \mapsto f_\ell$ gives a continuous map $U \to
  \map(\S^{n-1},\S^{n-1})$, whose image lies in a single connected
  component. Since $\RP^k$ is connected and can be covered by such
  $U$, it follows that $\deg(f_\ell)$ is constant. But above we noted
  that $f$ induces the identity over $\ell_{e_1}$, so in fact $f_\ell$
  must be a homotopy equivalence for all $\ell \in \RP^k$. We are then
  done by \pref{dold-fibre}.
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
  \label{RP-notation}
  Define $\lambda \ce \gamma - 1 \in \wt\K_\R(\RP^k)$ and $\nu \ce
  \kappa(\lambda) = \kappa(\gamma) - 1 \in \wt\K_\C(\RP^k)$.
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{j-reduction}
  Suppose $n = 2m$. If $\S^{n-1}$ admits a set of $k$ linearly
  independent vector fields, then $\J_\C(m\nu) = \J_\R(n\lambda) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Given the hypothesis, it is immediate from \pref{section-reduction}
  and \pref{RP-reduction} that $\J_\R(n\lambda) = 0$. And by
  definition we have $\J_\C(m\nu) = \J_\R(\iota(\kappa(m\lambda))) =
  \J_\R(2m\lambda) = \J_\R(n\lambda)$.
\end{proof}

So solving our problem now reduces to understanding
$\K_\Lambda(\RP^k)$ and $\J_\Lambda(\RP^k)$, and as indicated earlier
we will work with $\Lambda = \C$. We first address the former.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{K-theory of projective space}

\begin{notation}
  \label{kthy-order}
  Let $f_k \ce \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$.
\end{notation}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{RP-kthy}
  $\wt\K_\C(\RP^k)$ is generated by $\nu$, which satisfies the
  relations $\nu^2 = -2\nu$ and $\nu^{f_k+1} = 0$. This in fact
  determines a group isomorphism $\wt\K_\C(\RP^{k-1}) \simeq
  \Z/2^{f_k}$, which can be given explicitly via an injective morphism
  of (non-unital) rings
  \[
  \alpha \c \wt\K_\C(\RP^{k-1}) \to \Z/2^{f_k+1}, \quad \nu \mapsto
  -2.
  \]
  Finally, the Adams operations are given by
  \[
  \psi^l(\nu) =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if }l\text{ even} \\
    \nu & \text{if }l\text{ odd}.
  \end{cases}
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The case $k=1$ is trivial, so assume $k > 1$. Since real line
  bundles have structure group $\O(1) \simeq \{\pm 1\}$, it is trivial
  that $\gamma^2 = 1 \in \K_\R(\RP^k)$. It follows that
  $\kappa(\gamma)^2 = 1 \in \K_\C(\RP^k)$, and hence that $\nu^2 =
  -2\nu$.

  Next we prove $\nu^{f+1} = 0$. Since the tautological line bundle on
  $\RP^{k+1}$ pulls back to the tautological line bundle on $\RP^k$ in
  the inclusion $\RP^k \to \RP^{k+1}$, by naturality we may assume $k
  = 2f+1$ is odd. Let $\pi \c \RP^k \to \CP^f$ be the canonical
  projection, and let $\xi \to \CP^f$ be the tautological (complex)
  line bundle. It is easy to see directly that $\pi^*\xi \simeq
  \kappa(\gamma)$. Thus that $\nu^{f+1} = 0$ follows from the
  fact\footnote{One can see \cite{atiyah-kthy} or \cite{adams-vfields}
    for (two different) proofs.}  that $\wt\K_\C(\CP^f) \simeq
  \Z[t]/t^{f+1}$ where $t \ce \xi - 1$.

  We now show $\wt\K_\C(\RP^k) \simeq \Z/2^{f_k}$, using the
  Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
  \[
  E_2^{p,q} \ce \H^p(\RP^k,\K_\C^q(*)) \implies \K_\C^{p+q}(\RP^k).
  \]
  Recall Bott periodicity and the cohomology of projective space:
  \[
  \K_\C^q(*) \simeq
  \begin{cases}
    \Z & \text{if }q\text{ even} \\
    0 & \text{if }q\text{ odd},
  \end{cases}
  \hspace{30pt}
  \H^p(\RP^k;\Z) \simeq
  \begin{cases}
    \Z & \text{if }p=0 \\
    \Z/2 & \text{if }0 < p < k,\ p\text{ even} \\
    \Z & \text{if }p=k,\ k\text{ odd} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \]  
  Thus the spectral sequence looks like the following.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Thom classes in K-theory}

Before moving on to studying $\J_\C(\RP^{k-1})$ we need to discuss the
Thom isomorphism in K-theory, in particular the perspective given by
the \emph{difference bundle} construction of \cite{abs-clifford}.

\begin{nothing}
  \label{thom-iso}
  We first recall the basic theory of the Thom isomorphism. Let $\pi
  \c V \to X$ be a vector bundle of (real) rank $r$. Let $E$ be a
  multiplicative cohomology theory.
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item An \emph{$E$-orientation}, or \emph{Thom class}, of $V$ is a
    choice of $u \in E^r(V,V-0)$ such that for any fibre $i \c
    (\R^r,\R^r-0) \to (V,V-0)$ the restriction
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      E^r(V,V-0) \rar{i^*} & E^r(\R^r, \R^r-0) \rar{\sim} & E^0(*)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    sends $u$ to a multiplicative unit.
  \item The \emph{Thom isomorphism theorem} states that if $V$ is
    $E$-oriented with Thom class $u$ then the map
    \[
    \phi_{E,V} \c E^*(X) \to E^{*+r}(V,V-0), \quad x \mapsto \pi^*(x)
    \cdot u
    \]
    is an isomorphism.
  \end{itemize}
\end{nothing}

\begin{example}
  \label{taut-thom}
  Let $\gamma \to \CP^\infty$ be the tautological line bundle. We
  claim that $\Th(\gamma) \simeq \CP^\infty$ and, after composing with
  the periodicity map, the Thom isomorphism is 
  \[
  \K_\C(\CP^\infty) 
  \]
\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Characteristic classes}

We now begin our quest to understand $\J_\C(\RP^k)$. This will fall
out of Adams's more general results on the J-homomorphism, namely, the
construction of a certain quotient $\J_\Lambda(X) \surj
\J'_\Lambda(X)$, a ``lower bound'' on $\J_\Lambda(X)$. We begin with a
general discussion of characteristic classes, which will be used to
define the group $\J'_\Lambda(X)$.

\renewcommand{\V}{\mathcal{V}}
\newcommand{\cl}{\mathrm{cl}}
\begin{nothing}
  \label{chclass-general}
  Let $E$ and $F$ be multiplicative cohomology theories. Consider the
  following data.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $\V$ be some class of vector bundles equipped with natural
    $E$-orientations and $F$-orientations, and assume $\V$ is closed
    under pullback. I.e., for each bundle $\xi \to X$ in $\V$, say of
    dimension $r$, we have Thom classes $u_\xi \in E^r(\xi,\xi-0)$ and
    $t_\xi \in F^r(\xi,\xi-0)$, and for any pullback square
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      f^*\xi \rar{g} \dar & \xi \dar \\ Y \rar{f} & X,
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    $f^*\xi \to Y$ is also in $\V$ and is equipped with Thom classes
    $u_{f^*\xi} = g^*(u_\xi)$ and $t_{f^*\xi} = g^*(t_\xi)$.
  \item Let $T \c E \to F$ be a natural transformation of cohomology
    theories.
  \end{enumerate}
  Then for any $\xi \to X$ in $\V$ we can form a \emph{characteristic
    class}
  \[
  \cl(T,\xi) \ce \psi_\xi^{-1}T\phi_\xi(1) = T(u_\xi)/t_\xi \in
  F^*(X),
  \]
  where $\phi_\xi,\psi_\xi$ denote the Thom isomorphisms in $E,F$
  respectively. Note by naturality of our Thom classes, $\cl(T,\xi)$
  is natural in bundle maps $f^*\xi \to \xi$.
\end{nothing}

\begin{example}
  \label{stiefel-whitney}
  If we take $E = F = \H^*(-;\Z/2)$ in \pref{chclass-general} then we
  have natural orientations on all vector bundles. It turns out that
  if we set $T$ to be the Steenrod square $\Sq^i$ then the resulting
  characteristic class $\cl(\Sq^i,-)$ is just the Stiefel-Whitney
  class $w_i$.
\end{example}

\begin{definitions}
  Take $E = F = \K_\C^*$ and $T \ce \psi^l$ the Adams operation for $l
  \in \N$ in \pref{chclass-general}. The resulting classes $\rho^l \ce
  \cl(\psi^l,-)$ are called the \emph{cannibalistic
    classes}.\footnote{Because they live in K-theory and also eat
    things in K-theory.}
  Recall that all complex vector bundles are naturally
  $\H^*(-;\Q)$-oriented and $\K_\C$-oriented, and hence bh and
  $\rho^l$ are defined on all complex bundles.\footnote{The
    orientation issue is one of the subtleties mentioned above in
    working with $\K_\R$. In \cite{abs-clifford}, natural Thom classes
    in $\K_\R$ are constructed for $\Spin(8n)$ bundles, and this is
    what Adams begins with in the context of $\K_\R$.} Indeed, in
  \cite{abs-clifford}, natural Thom classes in $\K_\C$ for complex
  vector bundles are constructed with the following nice property. If
  $V_i \to X_i$, $i \in \{1,2\}$, are two complex vector bundles with
  Thom classes $u_i \in \K_\C^*(X_i)$, then the bundle $V_1 \times V_2
  \to X_1 \times X_2$ has Thom class $u_1u_2$ (after pulling back). We
  will use these classes of \cite{abs-clifford} so that, by definition
  of the direct sum and naturality, $\rho^l$ is \emph{exponential} in
  the sense that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{exponential}
    \rho^l(V_1 \oplus V_2) = \rho^l(V_1)\rho^l(V_2)
  \end{equation}
  when $X_1 = X_2$.
\end{definitions}

\begin{convention}
  \label{complex-convention}
  For the remainder, all bundles are complex vector bundles, and
  dimension always refers to complex dimension.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{cannibal-line}
  Let $\xi \to X$ be a line bundle. Then $\rho^l(\xi) = 1 + \xi +
  \cdots + \xi^{l-1}$ for $l \in \N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By naturality it suffices to prove this for the universal line
  bundle $\xi \to \CP^{\infty}$. By \pref{taut-thom}, $\Th(\xi) \simeq
  \CP^\infty$ with Thom class $\pm(\xi - 1) \in
  \tilde\K_\C(\CP^\infty)$. Then by definition of $\rho^l$ and
  $\psi^l$ we have
  \[
  \rho^l(\xi) = \frac{\psi^l(\pm(\xi-1))}{\pm(\xi-1)} = \frac{\xi^l -
    1}{\xi - 1} = 1 + \xi + \cdots + \xi^{l-1}. \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \label{cannibal-dim}
  By the splitting principle and the exponential property of $\rho^l$,
  \pref{cannibal-line} implies that for any bundle $\xi \to X$,
  $\dim \rho^l(\xi) = l^{\dim \xi}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{nothing}
  Combining \pref{exponential} and \pref{cannibal-line} gives
  $\rho^l(\epsilon_\C^{\oplus r}) = l^r$. This tells us that, after
  inverting $l$, we can extend the definition of $\rho^l$ from bundles
  to all of $\K_\C(X)$. Namely, since any element of $\K_\C(X)$ can be
  written in the form $\xi - r$ for some bundle $V$, we can define
  \[
  \rho^l \c \K_\C(X) \to \K_\C(X)_l, \quad \xi - r \mapsto
  \rho^l(\xi)/l^r,
  \]
  where $\K_\C(X)_l$ denotes the localisation at $l$. Since $\xi - r =
  \eta - s \iff \xi + s = \eta + r$, this is obviously well
  defined. And note we have preserved the exponential property:
  $\rho^l(x+y) = \rho^l(x)\rho^l(y)$ for $x,y \in \K_\C(X)$.
\end{nothing}

We next show how the cannibalistic classes $\rho^l$ allows us to bound
$\J_\C(X)$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{jprime-condition}
  Suppose $\J_\C(\xi) = \J_\C(\eta)$ for two bundles $\xi \to X$ and
  $\eta \to X$. Then there exists $y \in \wt\K_\C(X)$ such that $1+y
  \in \K_\C(X)$ is invertible and
  \[
  \rho^l(\eta) = \rho^l(\xi) \cdot \frac{\psi^l(1+y)}{1+y} \quad
  \text{for all } l \in \N.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The hypothesis is that there is a fibre homotopy equivalence $f \c
  S(\xi) \to S(\eta)$ over $X$. This extends to a homotopy equivalence
  of Thom complexes $g \c \Th(\xi) \to \Th(\eta)$. On each fibre, $g$
  induces a map $g_p \c \Th(\xi_p) \to \Th(\eta_p)$ which is just
  (homotopic to) the suspension of $f_p \c S(\xi_p) \to S(\eta_p)$;
  since $f_p$ is a homotopy equivalence so is $g_p$.

  Let $v \ce \phi_\xi^{-1}g^*\phi_\eta(1) = g^*(u_\eta)/u_\xi \in
  \K_\C(X)$. Since $g_p$ is a homotopy equivalence,
  \[
  g_p^*(u_{\eta_p}) = \pm u_{\xi_p} \quad \text{for }p \in X.
  \]
  It follows that $\dim v = \pm 1$. Let $\epsilon \ce \dim v \in
  \K_\C(X)$, so that $\dim \epsilon v = 1$, and hence $\epsilon v = 1
  + y$ for some $y \in \wt\K_\C(X)$.

  Let $h \c \Th(\eta) \to \Th(\xi)$ be a homotopy inverse to $g$ and
  define $w \ce \phi_\eta^{-1}h^*\phi_\xi(1) \in \K_\C(X)$. Since
  $\phi_\xi,\phi_\eta$ are isomorphisms of $\K_\C(X)$-modules and
  pullback respects multiplication, we have
  \[
  vw = \phi_\xi^{-1}g^*\phi_\eta(1) \cdot
  \phi_\eta^{-1}h^*\phi_\xi(1) =
  \phi_\eta^{-1}h^*\phi_\xi(\phi_\xi^{-1}g^*\phi_\eta(1)) = 1,
  \]
  and symmetrically $wv = 1$. So $w$ is inverse to $v$, and hence
  $\epsilon w$ is inverse to $\epsilon v$, implying $1+y$ is
  invertible.

  Finally let $l \in \N$. By naturality of the Adams operation
  $\psi^l$ we have.
  \[
  ((\phi_\xi^{-1}g^*\phi_eta)(\phi_\eta^{-1}\psi^l\phi_\eta))(1) =
  ((\phi_\xi^{-1}\psi^l\phi_\xi)(\phi_\xi^{-1}g^*\phi_\eta))(1)
  \]
  Then by definition of $\rho^l$, multplicativity of $\psi_l$, and the
  fact that $\phi_\xi$ is an isomorphism of $\K_\C(X)$-modules, we get
  \[
  v \cdot \rho^l(\eta) = \phi_\xi^{-1}(\psi^l(v \cdot u_\xi)) =
  \phi_\xi^{-1}(\psi^l(u_\xi)) \cdot \psi^l(v) = \rho^l(\xi) \cdot
  \psi^l(v).
  \]
  Now, multiplying this equation by $\epsilon = \psi^l(\epsilon)$ we
  get
  \[
  (1+y) \cdot \rho^l(\eta) = \rho^l(\xi) \cdot \psi^l(1+y),
  \]
  and since $1+y$ is invertible we are done.
\end{proof}

\begin{definitions}
  \label{jprime}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Let $V_\C(X) \subseteq \K_\C(X)$ be the subgroup of elements
    $x$ for which there exists $y \in \wt\K_\C(X)$ such that $1+y$ is
    invertible and
    \begin{equation}
      \label{jprime-y}
      \rho^l(x) = \frac{\psi^l(1+y)}{1+y} \in \K_\C(X)_l \quad \text{for
      } l \in \N.
    \end{equation}
    That $V_\C(X)$ is in fact a subgroup
    follows from the fact that each $\rho^l$ is exponential and each
    $\psi^l$ is multiplicative.
  \item Define $\J_\C'(X) \ce \K_\C(X)/V_\C(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{jprime-dim}
  $V_\C(X) \subseteq \wt\K_\C(X)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $x \in V_\C(X)$, and let $y$ is as in \pref{jprime}. Writing
  $x = \xi - \eta$ for bundles $\xi$ and $\eta$, we must have
  \[
  \rho^l(x) = \frac{\psi^l(1+y)}{1+y} \in \K_\C(X)_l \implies
  l^r(1+y)\rho^l(\xi) = l^r\psi^l(1+y)\rho^l(\eta) \in \K_\C(X).
  \]
  The Adams operations preserve dimension (by the splitting principle
  and their definition), so $\dim \psi^l(1+y) = \dim {(1+y)}$. It
  follows that $\dim \rho^l(\xi) = \dim \rho^l(\eta)$, whence $\dim
  \xi = \dim \eta$ by \pref{cannibal-dim}. Therefore $x \in
  \wt\K_\C(X)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{jprime-bound}
  The quotient map $\K_\C(X) \to \J_\C'(X)$ factors through
  $\J_\C$. That is, $\ker(\J_\C) \subseteq V_\C(X)$, so $\J_\C'(X)$
  is a quotient of $\J_\C(X)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Immediate from \pref{jprime-condition}.
\end{proof}

\section{Finishing}

We finally specialise to the case $X = \RP^k$. Computing
$\J_\C'(\RP^k)$ will give us enough information about $\J_\C(\RP^k)$
to give an upper bound to our question \pref{vfield-prob} on vector
fields.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{RP-cannibal}
  Let $\nu$ be the generator of $\wt\K_\C(\RP^k)$ as in
  \pref{RP-kthy}. For $l \in \N$ odd we have
  \[
  \rho^l(a\nu) = 1 + \frac{l^a-1}{2l^a}\nu \quad\text{for }0 \le a <
  2^{f_k}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\xi \ce \kappa(\gamma)$. By \pref{cannibal-line} and the
  identity $\xi^2 = 1$ we have
  \[
  \rho^l(\xi) = 1 + \xi + \cdots + \xi^{l-1} = \frac{l+1}2 +
  \frac{l-1}2\xi = l + \frac{l-1}{2}\nu.
  \]
  The desired identity for $a=1$ then follows from $\nu = \xi - 1
  \implies \rho^l(\nu) = \rho^l(\xi)/l$. Then $a > 1$ follows by
  induction using the relation $\nu^2 = -2\nu$ (and $a=0$ is trivial).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{RP-jprime}
  $V_\C(\RP^k) \subseteq \{0,2^{f_k-1}\nu\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x \in V_\C(\RP^k)$, and let $y \in \wt\K_\C(\RP^k)$ be such
  that \pref{jprime-y} holds By \pref{RP-kthy} we have $\psi^l(1+y) =
  1+y$ for $l$ odd, so we in fact have $\rho^l(x) = 1$ for $l$ odd.

  Next, $x \in \wt\K_\C(X)$ by \pref{jprime-dim}, so by \pref{RP-kthy}
  we can write $x = a\nu$ for some $0 \le a < 2^{f_k}$. Then from
  \pref{RP-cannibal} we know that
  \[
  \rho^l(x) = \rho^l(a\nu) = 1 + \frac{l^a-1}{2l^a}\nu.
  \]
  Recall the ring morphism $\alpha \c \wt\K_\C(\RP^k) \to
  \Z/2^{f_k+1}$ defined in \pref{RP-kthy} by $\alpha(\nu) \ce
  -2$. This gives a morphism of multiplicative groups $\beta \c 1 +
  \wt\K_\C(\RP^k) \to (\Z/2^{f_k+1})^\times$ via $\beta(1+z) \ce
  1+\alpha(z)$.

  So finally let $l$ be odd. Note $\wt\K_\C(\RP^k) \simeq \Z/2^{f_k}
  \implies \wt\K_\C(\RP^k)_l \simeq \wt\K_\C(\RP^k)$. Thus from the
  above we get
  \[
  1 = \rho^l(x) \implies 1 = \beta\l(1 + \frac{l^a-1}{2l^a}\nu\r) =
  1/l^a.
  \]
  We now use the fact that $(\Z/2^{f_k+1})^\times \simeq \Z/2 \times
  \Z/2^{f_k-1}$ has an element of order $2^{f_k-1}$ to see that
  choosing $l$ appropriately implies $2^{f_k-1} \mid a$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  There does not exist a set of $\rho(n) + 4$ linearly independent
  vector fields on $\S^{n-1}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  If $n$ is odd this is trivial by the hairy ball theorem
  \pref{hairy-ball}. So assume $n = 2m$, and suppose $\S^{n-1}$ admits
  a set of $k$ vector fields. Combining \pref{j-reduction},
  \pref{jprime-bound}, and \pref{RP-jprime} gives that $2^{f_k-1} \mid
  m \implies 2^{f_k} \mid n$. Then observe that $f_k \ge e_k - 1 \ge
  e_{k-4}$. By \pref{radon-max} it follows that $k-4 \le \rho(n) - 1
  \implies k \le \rho(n) + 3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  In addition to computing ${\J_\R}'(\RP^k)$, Adams computes
  ${\J_\R}'$ for spheres as well, by using another characteristic
  class coming from the formalism of \pref{chclass-general}. This
  gives bounds on the image of the J-homomorphism for spheres, where
  the study of the J-homomorphism originated.
\end{remark}
