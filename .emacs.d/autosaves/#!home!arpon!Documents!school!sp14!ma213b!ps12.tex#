\prob{1}

We know that the centers are given by the $12$ fixed points of order
$8$ automorphisms of $X$ and the vertices given by the $32$ fixed
points of order $3$ automorphisms of $X$. Consider the automorphism
\[
(X,Y,Z) \mapsto (Y,iX,Z),
\]
which we easily check to have order $8$. The point $(1,Y,0)$ is fixed
by this automorphism if and only if $i/Y = Y \iff Y^2 = i \iff Y = \pm
\zeta_8$. We can replace $iX$ with $-iX$ to get fixed points $(1,\pm
\zeta_8^3,0)$. Then applying the two cyclic permutations of the
coordinates give us that the other $8$ fixed points (corresponding to
the automorphisms resulting from composing with the cyclic
permutations of the coordinates).

For order 3, consider the automorphism
\[
(X,Y,Z) \mapsto (Z,X,Y),
\]
which has two fixed points $(\zeta_3^2,\zeta_3,1)$ and
$(\zeta_3,\zeta_3^2,1)$. We can then multiply $X$ by $i^\alpha$ and
$Y$ by $i^\beta$ for $\alpha,\beta \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ (corresponding
to composing the above automorphisms with these same multiplication
automorphisms) to get the $32 = 2 \cdot 4^2$ fixed points.

Observe that any two (non-identified) edges intersect at precisely one
point, corresponding to the vertices of the polygon. Given the
orientation on the $4g$-gon pictured on the left, we deduce that
locally at this point the cycles are oriented as in the picture to the
right. It follows that the matrix $J^{(g)} \ce (C_i \cdot C_j)_{1 \le
  i,j \le 2g}$ is equal to
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
  -1 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
  -1 & -1 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  -1 & -1 & -1 & \cdots & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Then since $C_{i+2g} = -C_i$ by definition of the identifications and
orientation, the full matrix $(C_i \cdot C_j)_{1 \le i,j \le 4g}$ is
just the block matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
  J^{(g)} & -J^{(g)} \\ -J^{(g)} & J^{(g)}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Finally we show $\det(J^{(g)}) = 1$. The claim is obvious for $g=1$, and
we proceed inductively. Define the minors
\[
A_{i,j} \ce
\begin{pmatrix}
  J^{(g)}_{1,i} & J^{(g)}_{1,j} \\
  J^{(g)}_{2,i} & J^{(g)}_{2,j}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and let $B_{i,j}$ be the complementary minor so that we have the
Laplace expansion
\[
\det(J^{(g)}) = \sum_{i < j} (-1)^{3+i+j} \det(A_{i,j})\det(B_{i,j}).
\]
Since $\det(A_{i,j}) = 0$ when $i,j \ge 3$ and $\det(A_{1,j}) =
\det(A_{2,j})$ and $\det(B_{1,j}) = \det(B_{2,j})$ when $j \ge 3$, it
follows that
\[
\det(J^{(g)}) = \det(A_{1,2})\det(B_{1,2}) = 1 \cdot \det J^{(g-1)} =
1.
\]

\prob{3}

Let $D \in \Div(X)$ with $\deg(D) = g$. We have
\[
\textstyle{\phi(P_1,\ldots,P_g) = [D] \iff \sum P_i \sim D \iff \sum
  P_i \in |D|.}
\]
So to show $\phi$ is surjective, we must show $|D|$ is nonempty, i.e.,
that $\h^0(D) > 0$. But this is immediate from Riemann-Roch:
\[
\h^0(D) = 1 + g - \deg(D) + \h^0(K-D) = 1 + \h^0(K-D) \ge 1.
\]

Now suppose $D \ge 0$. We claim $\dim \phi^{-1}([D]) > 0 \iff \h^0(D)
> 1$. If $\h^0(D) = 0$ then $|D| = \{D\}$ so $\phi^{-1}([D])$ is just
a finite set, proving one direction. Conversely, assume $\h^0(D) >
1$. Suppose $x = (P_1,\ldots,P_g) \in \phi^{-1}([D])$ so $\sum P_i =
(f) + D \in |D| \simeq \P \O_D(X)$. Since the zeros and poles of $f
\in \O_D(X)$ vary continuously, at $f \in \P\O_D(X)$ we locally have
an embedding into a neighbourhood of $x \in \phi^{-1}([D])$. Since
$\dim \P\O_D(X) = \h^0(D) - 1 > 0$, we must have $\dim \phi^{-1}(D) >
0$.

Finally we note, by Riemann-Roch as above, $\h^0(D) > 1 \iff \h^0(K-D)
> 0$, or equivalently (by definition) $D$ is a special divisor.

Recall that $X$ is given by the quotient of the octagon in the plane
by identifying opposite sides, and that the automorphism $T$
corresponds to rotation around the centre. If $C$ is

\subprob{a}

Let $\{\omega_i\},\{\eta_i\}$ be two orthonormal bases of
$\Omega(X)$. For each $i$ write $\eta_i = \sum_i a_{ij} \omega_j$, and
note by orthonormality we must have $\sum_i a_{ij} \oline{a_{ik}} =
\delta_{jk}$ for any $j,k$. It follows that
\[
\sum_i \eta_i \otimes \oline{\eta_i} = \sum_{i,j,k} a_{ij}\omega_j
\otimes \oline{a_{ik}\omega_k} = \sum_{j,k} \omega_j \otimes
\oline{\omega_k} \sum_i a_{ij} \oline{a_{ik}} = \sum_j \omega_j
\otimes \oline{\omega_j},
\]
so indeed the Bergman metric $\rho$ is independent of the choice of
basis.

\subprob{b}

Choose a basis $\{\omega_i\}$ of $\Omega(X)$. Denote by
$\{\omega_i^*\}$  the dual basis of $\Omega(X)^*$. This determines an
isomorphism $\Jac(X) \simeq \Omega(X)^*/\H_1(X;\Z) \simeq
\C^g/\Lambda$ which gives $\Jac(X)$ the euclidean metric $\sum_i
d\omega_i^* \otimes \oline{d\omega_i^*}$ (via the local isomorphism
$\C^g \to \C^g/\Lambda$).

Now let $\phi \c X \to \Jac(X)$ be the Abel-Jacobi map, that is,
choose a basepoint $p \in X$ and define $\phi(q) \ce \int_p^q$. In
terms of the basis $\{\omega_i^*\}$ we then have $\phi(q) = \sum_i
(\int_p^q \omega_i)\omega_i^*$. It follows that
\[
\textstyle{\phi^*(d\omega_i^*) = d(\omega_i^* \circ \phi) = d(\int_p^q
  \omega_i) = \omega_i}
\]
and similarly $\phi^*(\oline{d\omega_i^*}) = \oline{\omega_i}$. So
finally, under the map $\phi$ the euclidean metric pulls back to the
Bergman metric $\sum_i \omega_i \otimes \oline{\omega_i}$. Since we
know $\phi$ is an injection from lecture, this implies that $\phi$ is
an isometry (given these metrics).
