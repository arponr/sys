how was the cold
along the path i've determined to hold
although it coiled around the perilous wing
blinded with hot glass and carving of steam
there was the smoke

burned in the grass
reclaimed a portion of desolate sound
and in teh stories of long lost
barrels that had dust have fallen heat
then became a sound

i wasn't afforded a love covered up in hardedr clay
i wasn't afforded a star i was in it so much more
i wasn't afforded a love covered up in harded clay

time wasn't the only caverners

my hope my
out via a river out to an only ocean
there's something peaceful that goes via a river out to an ocean
i was peaceful, standing, i was open
