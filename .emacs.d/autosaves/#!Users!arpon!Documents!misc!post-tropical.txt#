speak until the dust
settles in the same specific place
light refused to go
drink it from a cast and iron plate
instead of cold milk
was offered unripe
instead of silence
considered craven

nothing made it seem
hidden where the aged soil was pure
pressed against the crease
mountains become fragrant at the source
so can you stand this
exotic angle
i read it somewhere
that they would lie still

i remember how the cloth hung
flexing with the forest clung
half waist and high raised arm
kicking at the slightest form
i remember my first love

unrelied i was told
missing teeth out of favour
nickel beach it was all
gathering by the sundial

i woke hard
i woke heavy from the half rain stopped
five whole hours
when i woke hard
i w heavy with the live or parts

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lakes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stolen away from last we dream

Feeling grey, cutting truth


Then when the climb it comes again

Give it all miles away
Wildest day ever taken hold
All that is called upon

Now to the lake where at last we go
I was not laid though was there below
Oh They did wait at the fork at the road
But the trailed showed faded fall

I hear the wind blow
Down to the morning
To recall I hear the wind blow

------------------------------
Red Dust

ki will not cave under you

Gold

how was the gold
alng the path determined to hold
perilous way
blnded with hot grass
there was so smoke

reclaim a portion 
and in the stories of long lost
barr
have fallen here

i was in the falling of love
coming up in harder clay
i was in the corner of the star
i was in it so much
i was in the falling of love
coming up in harder clay
time wasn't the only coward now

there's something peace
i was peaceful

--------------------------------------------------
All Points
--------------------------------------------------
in the canyon i was started young
in the ocean, in the valley run
there was hope that time would disappear
in the smoke and when the valley clears

and i think about the cold air
i've been thinking about cold air

i was in the dark
i was in the dark
i was

something
fixed the points and stretched around the skin
every breath that echoes endlessly
every point to ever let it leave

still i'm thinking of the cold air
always thinking of the cold air

i was in the dark
i was in the dark
i was

tripping the call distances you
lifting it all kept it with odds
taking the motion that have
siitting in teh foretress down in the dark
splitting into four 

i've been the thinking about the cold air
always thinking about the cold air

i was in the dark
i was in the dark
i was



--------------------------------------------------
look out
--------------------------------------------------
out with a golden resolve
and
now to the doorway
that's not lost

i was looking i was peeking over i was looking
in the corner feather flint the soul
i've heard it's all the same
and i hope i'm still alive of course
and the dust hits the sun

now when i pass through the gate
i will die with your hand
so i have gathered your
and them replaced them with

i was looking i was peeking over i was looking
in the corner feather flint the soul
i've heard it's all the same
and i hope i'm still alive of course
and the dust hits the sun

you'll be lucky once
waiting for the centre of
when the summer
drags you for miles
so you come around
as the weather starts to change
and you settle in
and the business it remains

------------------------------
Repeating
------------------------------
soon as the storm ends they'll come to haul
and build the highway
it was the song that i first saw

take it through the footsteps

then
from the ride i'll call you
where the wild wild
tremble light it comes i hardly knew
feel the weight in the horse that i took

we delayed every horse in the kingdom
we deferred every flow to a sinkhole
and we stare at the ruin of a signal
to repeat every word as it sings out

then
from the ride i'll call you
where the wild
tremble light it comes i hardly knew
feel the weight in the horse that i took

now it from the wall
that was stapled and made for the fall
the time it appeared
we received
not a fate or a cost in this place
nothing real to be bought or replaced
and the heats and the patterns alone
to repeat what had finally gone

and i swear it had all stopped at once
i could see what
underneath the arrival of june
it repeats

tremble light it comes i hardly knew

Post Tropical
------------------------------
rhythm comes
tepid and cold
crawling like snakes to a fold
chase it back
back to the ground
beating our fists to the sound

no one can look
how can anyone move on now
travel on
terrible
all our love giving it all away
who will run and who will save

on the hill
gathering men
there to divide through what's left
all they sell

throwing what's left in the street

no one can look
how could anyone move on now
travel on
terrible
all our giving it all away 
wo will run and who will save
first to leave last who gave
who will run and who will save

Glacier
------------------------------
some here's alive
somewhere undeerneath
caught between the reeling
mirroring the beat
i n olonger fish
years of sleep
show no sense of holding
staring aimlessly

i wanna go
south of the river
glacier slow
in the heart of the winter
i wanna go
south fo the river
face it alone
in the heart of the winter

and this with celebrate
this will settle
therein on the stage
this is a msitake
damn the earth below
dam the earth removed
damp and clawing evening
bursting into tune

in a moment i was cold
from a corridor
in the limit of a

i wanna go
south of the river
glacier slow
in the heart of the winter
i wanna go
south of the river
face it alone
in the heart of the winter

and i nodded at the love cry

few became
few became as glorious or unlocked as the forest they had started living near
ever since ever since the farest reaching island we had

someone here's alive
somewhere underneath
caught between the reeling
mirroring the beat
and i no longer fish
and in years we fought
show no sense of holding
and there's no sense at all
i was someone else
i was something pure
at the armour
at the door

i wanna go
south of the river
face it alone
in the heart of the winter
i wanna go
south of the river
face it alone
in the heart of the winter

outside digging

there is so little light from the warmth of the sun
there is so little light from the warmth of the sun
there is so little light from the warmth of the sun

till we existed
where nothing stood
bitter that we almost missed
staggered that it did not flood
and i look back and season
from under roof
burdening for different reason
burdened with a lesser fruit

and soft and soft
and steady as the sea

there is so little light from the warmth of the sun
there is so little light from the warmth of the sun
there is so little light from the warmth of the sun

i wish i had understood my heart
was not worried about single hearts
so i caught like a fragment of a single heart
and i caught like a fragment of a single heart
