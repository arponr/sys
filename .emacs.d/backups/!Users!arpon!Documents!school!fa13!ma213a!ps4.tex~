\prob{1}

Let $h := f/g$, a meromorphic function on $U$. For $z \in \del D$ we
have
\[
|f(z) - g(z)| < |f(z)| + |g(z)| \implies |h(z) - 1| < |h(z)| + 1.
\]
Observe in particular that this implies $h(z) \in \C - \R_{<0}$ for $z
\in \del D$. We proved in the previous problem set that $\C - \R_{<0}$
is simply connected, and hence there exists a holomorphic function
$\log : \C - \R_{<0} \to \C$ such that $\log'(z) = 1/z$. By the
evident fact that $\ord(h)|_\zeta = \ord(f)|_\zeta - \ord(g)|_\zeta$
for $\zeta \in D$ and the argument principle we get that
\[
\sum_{\zeta \in D} \ord(f)|_{\zeta} - \sum_{\zeta \in D} \ord(g)_\zeta
= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\del D} \frac{h'(z)}{h(z)}\,dz = \int_{\del
  D} d(\log \circ\, h) = 0,
\]
where the final equality is by exactness of the integrand.

\prob{2}

\subprob{a}

Let $t := 1-s$. For $R, r, \eta > 0$ we define the region
\[
\Omega_{R,r,\eta} := \{z \in \C \mid r \le |z| \le R\} - \{z \in \C
\mid \Re z > 0, |\Im z| < \eta\}.
\]
Then we have
\[
\del\Omega_{R,r,\eta} = A_{R,r,\eta} \cup B_{R,r,\eta} \cup
C_{R,r,\eta} \cup D_{R,r,\eta},
\]
where $A_{R,r,\eta} \subseteq \del\Delta(0,R)$, $B_{R,r,\eta}
\subseteq \R_{>0} - i\eta$, $C_{R,r,\eta} \subseteq \del\Delta(0,r)$,
and $D_{R,r,\eta} \subseteq \R_{>0} + i\eta$. Letting $R \to \infty$
and $r,\eta \to 0^+$ we have:
\begin{gather*}
\left|\int_{A_{R,r,\eta}} \frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz \right| \le
\int_{|z|=R} \left|\frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\right|\,dz = \int_{|z|=R}
\frac{R^{-t}}{R-a}\,dz \le \frac{2\pi R^{1-t}}{R-a} \to
0;\\ \int_{B_{R,r,\eta}} \frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz = \int_{B_{R,r,\eta}}
\frac{e^{-t\log(z)}}{z+a}\,dz \to -e^{-2\pi i t} \int_0^\infty
\frac{x^{-t}}{x+a}\,dx; \\ \left|\int_{C_{R,r,\eta}}
\frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz \right| \le \int_{|z|=r}
\left|\frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\right|\,dz = \int_{|z|=r}
\frac{r^{-t}}{a-r}\,dz \le \frac{2\pi r^{1-t}}{a-r} \to
0;\\ \int_{D_{R,r,\eta}} \frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz = \int_{D_{R,r,\eta}}
\frac{e^{-t\log(z)}}{z+a}\,dz \to \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{-t}}{x+a}\,dx;
\end{gather*}
where we have chosen a holomorphic branch of $\log : \C - \R_{> 0} \to
\C$ such that for $x \in \R_{> 0}$,
\[
\lim_{\eta \to 0^+} \log(x+i\eta) = \log(x) \quad\text{and}\quad
\lim_{\eta \to 0^+} \log(x-i\eta) = \log(x) + 2\pi i.
\]
It follows then that, taking the same limits,
\[
\int_{\del\Omega_{R,r,\eta}} \frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz \to (1-e^{-2\pi
  it}) \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{-t}}{x+a}\,dx.
\]
The residue theorem and Cauchy integral formula give that the left
hand side is equal to
\[
2\pi i \left.\Res\left(\frac{z^{-t}}{z+a}\,dz\right)\right|_{z=-a} =
2\pi i\,e^{-t\log(-a)} = 2\pi i\,a^{-t}e^{-\pi i t}.
\]
Finally we get that
\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{-t}}{x+a}\,dx = \frac{2\pi i\,a^{-t}e^{-\pi
    it}}{1-e^{-2\pi it}} = \frac{2\pi i\,a^{-t}}{e^{\pi it} - e^{-\pi
    it}} = \frac{\pi a^{-t}}{\sin(\pi t)}.
\]

\subprob{b}

First assume $s \ne 1$. Let $t := 1-s$ again. We apply the argument
from (a) identically, noting that $z^2 + 2z\cos(\theta) + 1 = (z +
e^{i\theta})(z+e^{-i\theta})$. We have
\begin{align*}
2\pi i \left.\Res\left(\frac{z^{-t}}{(z +
  e^{i\theta})(z+e^{-i\theta})}\,dz\right)\right|_{z=-e^{-i\theta}} &=
\frac{2\pi i(-e^{-i\theta})^{-t}}{e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}} =
\frac{\pi e^{it(\theta-\pi)}}{\sin(\theta)} \\
2\pi i \left.\Res\left(\frac{z^{-t}}{(z +
  e^{i\theta})(z+e^{-i\theta})}\,dz\right)\right|_{z=e^{-i\theta}} &=
\frac{2\pi i(-e^{i\theta})^{-t}}{e^{-i\theta} - e^{i\theta}} =
-\frac{\pi e^{-it(\theta+\pi)}}{\sin(\theta)},
\end{align*}
whence
\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{-t}}{x^2 + 2x\cos(\theta) + 1}\,dx =
\frac{\pi}{\sin(\theta)}\frac{e^{-\pi it}(e^{it\theta} -
  e^{it\theta})}{1 - e^{-2\pi it}} = \frac{\pi
  \sin(t\theta)}{\sin(\theta)\sin(\pi t)}.
\]

Now when $s=1$, so $t=0$, we can use more basic techniques to
integrate. Letting $u := \tan^{-1}((x+\cos(\theta))/\sin(\theta))$, we
have
\begin{align*}
\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{x^2+2x\cos(\theta)+1} &=
\frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta)} \int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\tan^2(u) +1} =
\frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \int_{\tan^{-1}(\cot(\theta))}^{\pi/2} du \\ &=
\frac{\pi - 2\tan^{-1}(\cot(\theta))}{2\sin(\theta)}.
\end{align*}

\prob{3}

\subprob{a}

Let $q : \C^2 - \{0\} \to \P^1$ the quotient map, and $i : \C \to \C^2
- \{0\}$ the map $z \mapsto (z,1)$. We know $q$ is continuous by
definition of the quotient topology on $\P^1$, and $i$ is continuous
by definition of the product topology on $\C^2$, since the components
are $\id : \C \to \C$ and the constant map $z \mapsto 1$, both of
which are continuous. Then $p_0 = q \circ i$ must be continuous, and
similarly we can show $p_\infty$ is continuous.

\subprob{b}

Given $[\xi : \eta] \in \P^1$ we must have either $\eta \ne 0$ or $\xi
\ne 0$. In the first case $[\xi : \eta] = [\xi/\eta : 1] =
p_0(\xi/\eta)$ and in the second $[\xi : \eta] = [1 : \eta/\xi] =
p_\infty(\eta/\xi)$. Thus $\P^1 = \im(p_0) \cup \im(p_\infty)$. By
definition of $\P_1$ it is clear that
\[
[z_1 : 1] = [z_2 : 1] \iff z_1 = z_2 \quad\text{and}\quad [1 : z_2] =
[1 : z_2] \iff z_1 = z_2,
\]
whence $p_0,p_\infty$ are injective.

\subprob{c}

From (b) it is easy to see that $[\xi : \eta] \in \im(p_0) \iff \eta
\ne 0$ and $[\xi : \eta] \in \im(p_\infty) \iff \xi \ne 0$. It follows
immediately that
\[
p_0^{-1}(\im(p_\infty)) = p_\infty^{-1}(\im(p_0)) = \C^*.
\]

\subprob{d}

Let $z \in \C^*$. Then $p_0(z) = [1 : z] = [z^{-1} : 1]$ so by
injectivity we must have $p_\infty^{-1}(p_0(z)) = z^{-1}$. Similarly
$p_0^{-1}(p_\infty(z)) = z^{-1}$.

\subprob{e}

Let $q : \C^2 - \{0\} \to \P^1$ the quotient map. Let $U :=
q^{-1}(\im(p_0)) \subseteq \C^2 - \{0\}$. By (c) there is a
well-defined map $j : U \to \C$ given by $(\xi,\eta) \mapsto
\xi/\eta$, which is clearly continuous. Recall that, since $\im(p_0)$
is open in $\P^1$, the restriction $q : U \to \im(p_0)$ is also a
quotient map. Thus $j$ induces a continuous map $\im(p_0) \to \C$,
which is clearly inverse to $p_0$. That is, $p_0$ is an embedding.

Now to show $\P^1$ is (homeomorphic to) the one point compactification
of $\C$ it suffices to show that $U \ni \infty$ is open in $\P^1$ if
and only if $K := \P^1 - U \subseteq \C$ is compact. Since compact
sets are closed in the Hausdorff space $\C$ the ``if'' direction is
obvious. For the ``only if'' direction, note that $K$ is a priori
closed, so by Heine-Borel it suffices to show $K$ is also
bounded. Since $U$ is open and contains $\infty$, and $p_\infty$ is
continuous, we have $p_\infty^{-1}(U) \supseteq \Delta(0,r)$ for some
$r >0$. By (d) it follows that
\[
p_0^{-1}(U) \supseteq p_0^{-1}(p_\infty(\Delta(0,r))) = \{ z^{-1} \mid
0 < |z| < r \} = \C - \oline\Delta(0, 1/r).
\]
But then $K \subseteq \oline\Delta(0, 1/r)$ must be bounded, and we're
done.

\subprob{f}

Observe that
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}a & a+b \\ c & c+d\end{pmatrix} \quad\text{and}\quad
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}a+c & b+d \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Similarly
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}a+b & b \\ c+d & d\end{pmatrix} \quad\text{and}\quad
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ a+c & b+d\end{pmatrix}.
\]
It follows that the matrix with coordinates $a,b,c,d \in \C$ lies in
the centre of $\GL(2,\C)$ only if $a = d$ and $b = c = 0$, i.e. the
matrix is $\lambda \cdot \id$ for some $\lambda \in \C$. It is then
clear that the centre of $\GL(2,\C)$ is $\{\lambda \cdot \id \mid
\lambda \in \C^*\}$. Since the matrix we multiplied by above has
determinant 1, the same argument gives that the centre of $\SL(2,\C)$
is $\{\pm \id\}$.

Now we show $\GL(n,\C)$ are connected. Let $A \in \GL(n,\C)$. We have
$B \in \GL(n,\C)$ such that $J := B^{-1}AB$ is in Jordan normal
form. For $t \in [0,1]$ define $J(t)$ by replacing the non-diagonal
elements (equal to 1) in $J$ with $1-t$. Note that $\det(J(t)) =
\det(J) = \det(B) \implies J(t) \in \GL(n,\C)$ for $t \in [0,1]$. Then
$J(1)$ is diagonal with entries in $\C^*$, and since $\C^*$ is clearly
path conected we can then define $J(t) \in \GL(n,\C)$ for $t \in
[1,2]$ a path from $J(1)$ to $\id$. Finally, this gives a continuous
path $\gamma : [0,2] \to \GL(n,\C)$ given by $\gamma(t) :=
BJ(t)B^{-1}$, so
\[
\gamma(0) = BJB^{-1} = A \quad\text{and}\quad \gamma(2) = B \id B^{-1}
= \id.
\]
Since $A$ was arbitrary, this shows that $\GL(n, \C)$ is
(path-)connected. Since $\PGL(n,\C)$ is a quotient of $\GL(n, \C)$ it
is also (path-)connected.

Essentially the same argument gives that $\SL(2,\C)$ is
connected. Indeed we just have to alter the path from $J$ to $\id$ so
that it lies in $\SL(2,\C)$. Observe that the diagonal entries of
$J(1)$ must be $\lambda, \lambda^{-1}$ for some $\lambda \in \C^*$ if
we begin with $A \in \SL(2,\C)$. Then choosing a path in $\C^*$ from
$\lambda$ to $1$ also defines a continuous path from $\lambda^{-1}$ to
$1$, which defines the necessary path from $J(1)$ to $\id$.
