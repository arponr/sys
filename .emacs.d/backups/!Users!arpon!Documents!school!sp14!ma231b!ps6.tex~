\prob{1}

Let $n \ge 2$ even. As in lecture, the sequence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \S^{2n-1} \rar{f} & \S^n \rar{i} & X \rar{p} & \S^{2n}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
along with the chern character $\ch$ induce the following commutative
diagram with exact rows:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  0 \rar &
  \rK(\S^{2n}) \rar{p^*} \dar{\ch} &
  \rK(X) \rar{i^*} \dar{\ch} &
  \rK(\S^n) \rar \dar{\ch} &
  0 \\
  0 \rar &
  \rH^*(\S^{2n}) \rar{p^*}
  & \rH^*(X) \rar{i^*}
  & \rH^*(\S^n) \rar &
  0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Let $a \in \rK(\S^n) \simeq \Z$ and $b \in \rK(\S^{2n})$ be
generators. From lecture we know then that $s \ce \ch(a) \in
\rH^n(\S^n) \simeq \Z$ and $t \ce \ch(b) \in \rH^{2n}(\S^{2n}) \simeq
\Z$ are generators. Choose $\alpha,\beta \in \rK(X)$ such that
$i^*(\alpha) = a$ and $p^*(b) = \beta$. Up to sign, the Hopf invariant
in K-theory is given by $\alpha^2 = \h_\K(f) \cdot \beta$. Now let
$\sigma,\tau \in \H^*(X)$ such that $i^*(\tau) = t$ and $\sigma =
p^*(s)$. Since
\[
p^* \c \H^{2n}(\S^{2n}) \to \H^{2n}(X), \quad i^* \c \H^n(X) \to
\H^n(\S^n)
\]
are isomorphisms, the Hopf invariant in ordinary cohomology is, up to
sign, given by $\sigma^2 = \h_\H(f) \cdot \tau$. But by commutativity
of the diagram we have
\[
\sigma^2 = \ch(\alpha)^2 = \ch(\alpha^2) = \ch(\h_\K(f) \cdot \beta) =
\h_\K(f) \cdot \ch(\beta) = \h_\K(f) \cdot \tau,
\]
so indeed (up to sign) $\h_\H(f) = \h_\K(f)$.

\prob{2}

\subprob{a}

If $n$ is odd then by graded-commutativity of multiplication in
$\rH(X)$,
\[
\sigma^2 = -\sigma^2 \implies \sigma^2 = 0 \implies \h(f) = 0.
\]

\subprob{b}

Consider the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  
\end{tikzcd}
\]

\prob{3}

Let $X$ be the cofiber of $f \ce F \circ g$ and $Y \simeq S^n \times
S^n$ be the cofiber of $g$. Then $F$ induces a map $\phi \c Y \to
X$. Let $x \in \H^n(X)$, $y \in \H^{2n}(X)$, $x_1',x_2' \in \H^n(Y)$,
and $y' \in \H^{2n}(Y)$ be generators. It's clear that $\phi^*(x) =
x_1' + x_2'$ and $\phi^*(y) = y'$. Moreover we know that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(x_1')^2 = (x_2')^2 = 0$ and $x_1'x_2' = x_2'x_1' = \pm y'$
  (here we have used that $n$ is even);
\item $\phi^*(x) = x_1' + x_2'$ and $\phi^*(y) = y'$.
\end{itemize}
By definition of the Hopf invariant we have $x^2 = h(f)y$, so it
follows that
\begin{align*}
  h(f)y' &= \phi^*(x^2) = (x_1'+x_2')^2 = x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + x_2x_1 +
  x_2^2 = \pm2y',
\end{align*}
implying $h(f) = \pm2$.

\prob{4}

By definition of the Hopf fibration, its cofiber is given by $X \simeq
\C\P^2$. If $\sigma \in \H^2(X)$ is a generator then we know $\H^*(X)
\simeq \Z[\sigma]/(\sigma^3)$, which of course implies that the
fibration has Hopf invariant one.
