dark dark night and cold cold flow  
i'm still alone  
i guess that's dope  
stay on this boat  

black black crow in white white snow  
i miss you so  
i guess that's dope  
i'm drifting slow  

on this river  
on this black river  
where orange lights are few and far between  
stay in the current of time unseen  

dark dark stars and cold cold moon  
at the break of noon  
i'm lost at truth  
what's there to do  

black black heart in white white dunes  
regret accrued  
i'm lost at truth  
i'll float on through  

on this river  
on this black river  
where orange lights are few and far between  
stay in the current of time unseen
