\prob{2}

Let $f : S_{r_1,r_2} \to \C$ a holomorphic function. We define a
function $g : B_{r_2} \to \C$ as follows (as suggested in the
problem). Let $w \in B_{r_2}$. Then $0 \le \sum_{i=2}^n |w_i|^2 <
r_2$, so we can choose $r > |w_1|$ such that $C(w,r) \subseteq
S_{r_1,r_2}$. Since $f$ is continuous on $S_{r_1,r_2}$ we can define
\[
g(w) \coloneqq \int_{|\zeta|=r} \frac{f(\zeta,w_2,\ldots,w_n)}{\zeta -
  w_1} \,d\zeta.
\]
Moreover, since $f$ is holomorphic and hence, by definition,
holomorphic as a function of its first variable, $g(w)$ is independent
of our choice of $r$. This in particular implies that, if $U$ is the
open neighbourhood $\{z \in B_{r_2} \mid C(z,r) \subseteq S_{r_1,r_2}
\text{ and } r > |z_1|\}$ of $w$, then
\begin{equation}
  \label{multi-cauchy}\tag{$*$}
  g(z) = \int_{|\zeta|=r} \frac{f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)}{\zeta - z_1}
  \,d\zeta \quad\text{for } z \in U.
\end{equation}

\medskip
We claim this last statement implies $g$ is holomorphic on
$B_{r_2}$. Since holomorphicity is a local question, it suffices to
show $g$ is holomorphic on the open set $U$ defined above. Let $R$ a
rectangle in the coordinate $z_i$ with $\cl(R) \subseteq U$ and $\del
R$ parallel to the $\Re(z_i)$ and $\Im(z_i)$ axes. By
(\ref{multi-cauchy}) and Fubini, we have
\[
\int_{\del R} g(z)\,dz_i = \int_{\del R}\int_{|\zeta|=r}
\frac{f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)}{\zeta - z_1} \,d\zeta\,dz_i =
\int_{|\zeta|=r}\int_{\del R} \frac{f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)}{\zeta -
  z_1} \,dz_i\,d\zeta.
\]
By definition of $r$ and $U$ we know $f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)/(\zeta -
z_1)$ is holomorphic on $U$ for any $|\zeta|=r$, in particular
holomorphic as a function of $z_i$. It follows that
\[
\int_{\del R} \frac{f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)}{\zeta - z_1} \,dz_i = 0
\quad\text{for } |\zeta| = r \implies \int_{\del R} g(z)\,dz_i = 0.
\]
Thus $g$ is holomorphic as a function of $z_i$, and since $1 \le i \le
n$ was arbitrary, $g$ is holomorphic on $U$, and hence on $B_{r_2}$.

\medskip
Finally note that if $z \in S_{r_1,r_2}$, then since $f$ is
holomorphic as a function of its first variable we have
\[
g(z) = \int_{|\zeta|=r} \frac{f(\zeta,z_2,\ldots,z_n)}{\zeta - z_1}
\,d\zeta = f(z)
\]
by Cauchy's integral formula. Thus $g$ extends $f$, finishing the
problem.

\subprob{a}

We show $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x\log^n(x) = 0$ for $n \ge 0$, which of
course proves the claim of the problem. The case $n = 0$ is
tautological. For $n > 0$ we apply L'H\^{o}pital and see inductively
that
\[
\lim_{x \ 0^+} x \log^n(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\log^n(x)}{1/x}
= \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{n\log^{n-1}(x) /x}{-1/x^2} = -n
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x\log^{n-1}(x) = 0.
\]

\prob{4}

Let $c : \Delta \to \H$ denote the Cayley transform and $c^{-1} : \H
\to \Delta$ its inverse. Let $f : \R \to \R$ be continuous. Then $g
\coloneqq f \circ c : \del\Delta \to \R$ is continuous so by the
Poisson integral formula on the disk (proved in the homework), if we
set
\[
v(re^{i\theta}) \coloneqq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} P_r(\theta -
\phi) g(e^{i\phi}) \,d\phi = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \Re\l(
\frac{e^{i\phi} + re^{i\theta}}{e^{i\phi} - re^{i\theta}}\r)
g(e^{i\phi}) \,d\phi,
\]
then $v : \Delta \to \R$ is harmonic and satisfies $v(re^{i\theta})
\to g(\theta)$ as $r \to 1$.

\medskip
Now set $u \coloneqq v \circ c^{-1} : \H \to \R$. Since $c^{-1}$ is
holomorphic and $v$ is harmonic, $u$ must be harmonic. (Indeed, $v :
\Delta \to \R$ must be the real part of a holomorphic function $h :
\Delta \to \C$, whence $u$ is the real part of the holomorphic
function $h \circ c^{-1} : \H \to \R$, and hence harmonic.) Moreover
since $v$ extends continuously to the boundary as specified above, we
have for $x \in \R$ that
\begin{align*}
\lim_{y \to 0^+} u(x+iy) &= \lim_{y \to 0^+} v(c^{-1}((x+iy)) = \lim_{y
  \to 0^+} v\l( \frac{x+i(y-1)}{x+i(y+1)} \r) = \lim_{z \to
  \frac{x+i}{x-i}} v(z) \\ &= g\l( \frac{x-i}{x+i} \r) = g(c^{-1}(x))
= f(x).
\end{align*}

\medskip
We use a change of variables to determine the kernel $Q_y$. In
particular, set $t \coloneqq c(e^{i\phi}) \in \R$. Then $g(e^{i\phi})
= f(c(e^{i\phi})) = f(t)$. We first make some simple computations that
we will need. Note $e^{i\phi} = c^{-1}(t) = (t-i)/(t+i)$, so that
\begin{align*}
  \Re(e^{i\phi}) &= \Re\l( \frac{t-i}{t+i} \r) = \frac{1}{2}\l(
  \frac{t-i}{t+i} + \frac{t+i}{t-i} \r) = \frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}, \\
  \Im(e^{i\phi}) &= \Im\l( \frac{t-i}{t+i} \r) = \frac{1}{2i}\l(
  \frac{t-i}{t+i} - \frac{t+i}{t-i} \r) = \frac{-2t}{t^2+1}.
\end{align*}
By the quotient rule and the above,
\[
dt = d\l( i\cdot\frac{1+e^{i\phi}}{1-e^{i\phi}} \r) =
\frac{-2e^{i\phi}}{(1-e^{i\phi})^2}\,d\phi =
\frac{1}{1-\Re(e^{i\phi})}\,d\phi \implies d\phi =
\frac{2\,dt}{t^2+1}.
\]
Now let $z = x+iy \in \H$; then
\begin{align*}
  \Re\l( \frac{e^{i\phi} + c^{-1}(z)}{e^{i\phi} - c^{-1}(z)} \r) &=
  \Re\l( \frac{e^{i\phi}(z+i) + (z-i)}{e^{i\phi}(z+i) - (z-i)} \r)
  \\ &= \frac{1}{2} \l( \frac{e^{i\phi}(z+i) + (z-i)}{e^{i\phi}(z+i) -
    (z-i)} + \frac{e^{-i\phi}(\oline z-i) + (\oline
    z+i)}{e^{-i\phi}(\oline z-i) - (\oline z+i)} \r).
\end{align*}
By putting the two terms over a common denominator and doing some
simple algebra (omitted for the sake of concision) we get that the
above is equal to
\[
\frac{2y}{(x^2+y^2)(1-\Re(e^{i\phi})) + (1+\Re(e^{i\phi})) +
  2x\Im(e^{i\phi})}.
\]
Then the previous computations imply this is equal to
\[
\frac{y(t^2+1)}{x^2+y^2+t^2-2xt} = \frac{y(t^2+1)}{(x-t)^2 + y^2}.
\]
Finally we can change variables in the Poisson integral formula:
\begin{align*}
u(z) &= v(c^{-1}(z)) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \Re\l(
\frac{e^{i\phi} + c^{-1}(z)}{e^{i\phi} - c^{-1}(z)}\r) g(e^{i\phi})
\,d\phi \\ &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_\R
\frac{y(t^2+1)}{(x-t)^2+y^2} f(t) \,\frac{2\,dt}{t^2+1} =
\frac{1}{\pi} \int_\R \frac{y}{(x-t)^2+y^2}f(t)\,dt.
\end{align*}
Thus the kernel is given by
\[
Q_y(x) \coloneqq \frac{1}{\pi} \l(\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\r).
\]
Note that the transformed integral converges absolutely since the
Poisson integral on the unit disk (over the compact interval
$[0,2\pi]$) must converge absolutely.
