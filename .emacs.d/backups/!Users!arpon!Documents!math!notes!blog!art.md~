Beauty and Art
==============

Lying on the shore, reading *Kafka on the Shore*, how could I *not*
think about beauty and art? This time, though, I managed to think some
thoughts I think are actually worth writing down---for my future self,
at least.

Before I begin, a disclaimer about what I mean when I say "art": I'm
really thinking of literature, since that's what set this train of
thought in motion. But I'm using the word "art" instead, because I
suspect/hope that what I'm saying applies more generally, e.g. to the
visual arts.

The purposes of art and science
-------------------------------

That I am a math student could probably be deduced from the set of
people I actually talk to: a bunch of math people; a sprinkling of
computer science, physics, and economics people; and two lonely
humanities people, one of whom could just as well be included in the
first two subsets. The point is, I don't talk all that much about art.
But when I do, the main question a number of times has been, "what's
the point of it?" or "what does it accomplish?"
