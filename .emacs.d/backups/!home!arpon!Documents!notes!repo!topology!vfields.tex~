\section{The problem}

For the sake of completeness, we state the basic definitions.

\begin{definitions}
  Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. Let $\pi \c T \to M$ be the
  tangent bundle on $M$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{vector field} on $M$ is a continuous section $v \c M
    \to T$ of $\pi$.
  \item A set of vector fields $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$ on $M$ is
    \emph{linearly independent} if for each $p \in M$ the vectors
    $v_1(p),\ldots,v_k(p)$ are linearly independent in the tangent
    space $T_p$. In particular a single vector field $v$ forms a
    linearly independent set if and only if it is nowhere vanishing.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definitions}

Now we begin the actual story. We are taught to love spheres from our
very first days in the land of topology. But perhaps it is the
following result---or perhaps really its title---which first truly
beguiles us.

\begin{theorem}[Hairy ball]
  For $n \ge 2$, the sphere $\S^{n-1}$ admits a nowhere vanishing
  vector field if and only if $n$ is even.
\end{theorem}

Of course, so enticed, we cannot just leave it there. We must ask the
following.

\begin{question}
  Then how many vector fields does $\S^{n-1}$ admit? Or more
  precisely, what is the maximum size of a set of linearly independent
  vector fields on $\S^{n-1}$?
\end{question}

This is one of those problems that occupied people for a while. To get
a lower bound on the problem is not so hard (especially with
hindsight). The theory of Clifford algebras gives the following
result.

\begin{definition}
  Let $n \ge 2$. Write $n = 2^ab$ with $b$ odd, and write $a = 4c +
  d$. Then we define the \emph{Radon-Hurwitz number} $\rho(n) \ce 2^d
  + 8c$. Note in particular that $\rho(n) = 1$ if $n$ is odd.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  There exist $\rho(n)-1$ linearly independent vector fields on
  $\S^{n-1}$.
\end{theorem}

Getting an upper bound is where the real difficulty is. Let's try to
think about it for a second.
