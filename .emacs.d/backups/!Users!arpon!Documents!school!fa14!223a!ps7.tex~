\prob{1}

Suppose there were a compact neighborhood $Z$ of $0 \in \prod_{v \in
  V_K} K_v$. Then $Z$ must contain a basis element $\prod_{v \in S}
W_v \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} K_v$ for some finite set $S \subseteq
V_K$. Since $V_K$ is infinite we can choose $v \in V_K - S$ and then
projection restricts to a continuous surjection $Z \surj K_v$. This
implies $K_v$ is compact, in particular bounded. But since $K_v$
contains $\Q$ in the topology of one of its absolute values (all of
which we know by Ostrowski), this is a contradiction.

\prob{2}

By Ostrowski we know $\Q$ has a unique archimedian place $v_\infty$
with $\Q_{v_\infty} \iso \R$, and non-archimedean places $v_p$ coming
from the (positive) primes $p \in \Z$ with $\Q_{v_p} \iso \Q_p$. And
recall we have a ring isomorphism $\hat Z \iso \prod_p \Z_p$. So by
definition to prove the claim it suffices to give a ring isomorphism
\[
\phi \c \l(\prod_p \Z_p\r) \otimes_\Z \Q \to {\prod_p}' \Q_p \ce
\l\{(x_p) \in \prod_p \Q_p : x_p \in \Z_p \text{ for all but finitely
  many } p\r\}.
\]
Since $\otimes_\Z$ is the coproduct for rings, to define $\phi$ we
just need to define maps
\[
\prod_p \Z_p \to {\prod_p}' \Q_p, \quad \Q \to {\prod_p}' \Q_p.
\]
The first is given by the obvious inclusion. The second we define by
sending $r \in \Q$ to $(-1)^s(p^{n_p})$, where $r = (-1)^s\prod_p
p^{n_p}$ is the unique factorization of $r$; note this makes sense
since $n_p = 0$. Both of these are clearly ring morphisms, so they
define a ring morphism $\phi$ as above.

To prove $\phi$ is an isomorphism we define an inverse as follows. For
any $(x_p) \in \prod'_p \Q_p$ we can write $x_p = p^{n_p}y_p$ such
that $n_p \in \Z$ and $y_p \in \Z_p$ for all $p$, and moreover $n_p =
0$ for all but finitely many $p$. Then the inverse map sends $(x_p)
\mapsto (y_p) \otimes r$ where $r \ce \prod_p p^{n_p}$. It's clear
from the definition of the tensor product that this map doesn't depend
on the choices of $n_p$, and hence that the map is a well-defined ring
morphism. Moreover it is evidently an inverse to $\phi$.

\prob{3}

\subprob{a}

In lecture we have show that the diagonal embedding $i \c K \inj \A_K$
is closed and discrete and has compact cokernel. Thus it is an
isomorphism up to compact groups. Now consider the open subgroup
$\A_K(S) \ce \prod_{v \in S} K_v \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v$ of
$\A_K$: we have $\O_{K,S} = i^{-1}(\A_K(S))$. Thus the diagonal
embedding $\O_{K,S} \to \A_K(S)$ is an isomorphism up to compact
groups, in particular has compact cokernel. But since $\A_K(S)$
surjects via the projeciton onto $\prod_{v \in S} K_v$, it follows
that the diagonal map $\O_{K,S} \to \prod_{v \in S} K_v$ also has
compact cokernel.

To show $\O_{K,S}$ has discrete image $\prod_{v \in S} K_v$ it
suffices to show $0$ has an open neighborhood $W$ disjoint from the
image of $\O_{K,S} - \{0\}$. We take $W \ce \prod_{v \in S} B_v(0,1)$
the product of open balls of radius $1$ around $0$; if $x \in
(\O_{K,S} - \{0\}) \cap W$ then we have
\[
\prod_{v \in V_K} |x|_v = \l(\prod_{v \in S} |x|_v\r) \l(\prod_{v \in
  V_K - S} |x|_v\r) = ab,
\]
where $a < 1$ since $x \in W$ and $b \le 1$ since $x \in
\O_{K,S}$. But this contradicts the product formula, so no such $x$
exists.

\subprob{b}

Let $T \ce S - S'$, recall the notation that $\A_{K,T}$ is the image
of $\A_K$ in the natural map to $\prod_{v \in V_K - T} K_v$. Let
$\A_{K,T}(S)$ denote the subspace $\prod_{v \in S'} K_v \times
\prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v$. Since $T$ is nonempty, the strong
approximation theorem implies that the the diagonal map $j \c K \to
\A_{K,T}$ has dense image. As in (a), we have $\O_{K,S} =
j^{-1}(\A_{K,T}(S))$, so $\O_{K,S}$ must have dense image in
$\A_{K,T}(S)$. Then since $\A_{K,T}(S)$ surjects onto $\prod_{v \in
  S'} K_v$, this implies $\O_{K,S}$ has dense image there as well.

A basic open neighborhood of $1 \in \A_\Q$ is of the form $\prod_{v
  \in S} B_v(1,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v$ for some $r >
0$. Since $v_p(n!) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ for all primes $p$,
it's clear that the sequence $(a^{(n)})$ is eventually contained in
any such basic neighborhood, and hence converges to $1$ in $\A_\Q$.

On the other hand a basic open neighborhood of $1 \in J_\Q$ is of the
form $\prod_{v \in S} B_v(1,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S}
\O_v^\times$. Suppose $3 \in S$ but $2 \notin S$. Then for $r$ small
enough, if $a^{(n)}$ is contained in the set we must have $3 \mid n!$
but $2 \nmid n!$. This is impossible, so the sequence does not
converge to $1$ in $J_\Q$.

\subprob{b}

(I looked at Cassels-Frohlich.) We first show $J_K^1$ is closed in
$\A_K$. Let $x = (x_v) \in \A_K - J_K^1$, so $c(x) \ce \prod_{v \in
  V_K} |x_v|_v \ne 1$ (note that the product still makes sense in
$\A_K$ since $|x_v|_v \le 1$ for all but finitely many $v$). There are
now two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $c(x) < 1$. Then there is a finite set $S \subset V_K$
  containing all $v$ such that $|x_v| > 1$ such that $\prod_{v \in S}
  |x_v|_v < 1$. Then it's clear that, for $r > 0$ small enough, the
  open neighborhood
  \[
  \prod_{v \in S} B_v(x_v,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v
  \]
  of $x$ does not intersect $J_K^1$.
\item Suppose $c(x) > 1$. Then there is a finite set $S \subset V_K$
  containing all $v$ such that $|x_v| > 1$ such that $1 < \prod_{v \in
    S} |x_v|_v < 2C$ and for $v \in V_K - S$ we have $|y_v|_v < 1
  \implies |y_v|_v < 1/(2c(x))$; the latter condition can be met
  because of the normalizations we are using on the $|-|_v$. Now we
  can choose $r > 0$ small enough such that if $|y_v - x_v| < r$ for
  $v \in S$ then $1 < \prod_{v \in S} |y_v|_v < 2C$. Then for any $y$
  in the open neighborhood
  \[
  W \ce \prod_{v \in S} B_v(x_v,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v
  \]
  of $x$, either $|y_v|_v = 1$ for all $v \in V_K - S$, implying $c(y)
  > 1$, or else $|y_v|_v < 1/(2c(x))$ for some $v \in V_K - S$,
  implying $c(y) < 1$. Thus $W$ does not intersect $J_K^1$.
\end{itemize}

We now prove that the topologies on $J_K^1$ induced from $\A_K$ and
$J_K$ agree. A basis element in $\A_K$ is of the form $\prod_{v \in S}
W_v \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_v$, and this evidently contains
the basis element $\prod_{v \in S} W_v \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S}
\O_v^\times$ of $J_K$. So we just need to show the converse
containment of bases. Take a basis element
\[
W \ce \prod_{v \in S} B_v(x_v,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S}
\O_V^\times
\]
of $J_K$ which intersects $J_K^1$. As in the second case above, we may
assume take $r$ small enough so that $c(y) < 2$ for all $y \in W$ and
$S$ large enough so that for $v \in V_K - S$ that $|y_v|_v < 1
\implies |y_v|_v < 1/2$. Then if $y \in W \cap J_K^1$ we must have
$|y_v|_v = 1$ for $v \in V_K - S$. I.e. $W \cap J_K^1$ is equal to the
intersection of the $\A_K$ basis element
\[
\prod_{v \in S} B_v(x_v,r) \times \prod_{v \in V_K - S} \O_V
\]
with $J_K^1$. This proves the desired containment.

\prob{5}

Since $\Cl_K$ is finite there is a finite set of finite primes $S'$
such that the group $I_K(S')$ of fractional ideals generated by $S'$
surjects onto $\Cl_K$. Let $S \ce S' \cup V_k^\infty$.

Now consider any $x = (x_v) \in J_K$. Define the fractional ideal $\a
\ce \prod_{v \in V_K^f} \p_v^{v(x_v)} \in I_K$. Since $I_K(S')$
surjects onto $\Cl_K$ there is some $b \in K^\times$ such that
\[
\a \cdot (b) = \prod_{v \in V_K^f} \p_v^{v(x_v) + v(b)}
\]
lies in $I_K(S')$, i.e. $v(x_v) + v(b) = 0$ for all $v \notin
S'$. Therefore $bx \in J_K(S)$. Since $x$ was arbitrary we have proven
that $J_K = K^\times \cdot J_K(S)$.
