\prob{1}

Let $K$ be the complex with $\Z/2$ concentrated in degree $1$ and $L$
the complex with $\Z \to \Z, n \mapsto 2n$ concentrated in degrees $0$
and $1$. Observe $\hom_{K(A)}(K,L) \simeq 0$ since $\hom_A(\Z/2,\Z)
\simeq 0$. On the other hand, the projection $\Z \to \Z/2$ in degree
$1$ clearly defines a quasi-isomorphism $p \c L \to K$ in $K(A)$. So
$0 \ne p^{-1} \in \hom_{D(A)}(Q(K),Q(L))$, implying $\hom_{K(A)}(K,L)
\to \hom_{D(A)}(Q(K),Q(L))$ is not surjective.
