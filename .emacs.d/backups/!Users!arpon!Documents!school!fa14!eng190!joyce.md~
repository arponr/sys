    Reaction to "Blind Streets and Seeing Houses: 'Araby'"

"Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the
earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden
beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was
thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to
veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them . . ."
(Joyce 23). The poetic language of "Araby" leaps out at the reader,
especially in the context of the surrounding stories in
*Dubliners*. Norris argues that, while this poetry is often viewed as
"offering art as balm to heal the anguish of a modern cityâ€™s
paralysis" (Norris 45), it should instead be viewed as "ornate but
empty narration, doubl[ing] 'Araby,' the ornate but empty bazaar"
(Norris 46) featured in the story.

Norris argues this point convincingly by examining more carefully the
poetry of "Araby", in particular the "story's solipsism and
insularity" (Norris 48) conveyed by the repeated and varied use of the
word "blind". E.g., the boy is described as living in a "blind" cul de
sac and tracking the object of his love through a slight gap in the
window blinds. These two examples connect also with the stagnant,
enclosed settings of the boy's house, and the fact that the girl
indeed appears more as an object---"as a cut-up fetish apprehended
chiefly in metonymic parts as a rope of hair, a silver bracelet, a
white curve of neck, an illuminated hand" (Norris 50)---in the boy's
(blind) eye. This all serves as evidence for Norris's suggestion that
"Araby" is not merely an adolescent love story meant to evoke empathy,
but instead depicts the empty, blind, obsessive nature of what we
perceive as the boy's love, and that this is mirorred in what we
perceive as poetic language in the story.

I find this interpretation very convincing, and indeed is how I read
the conclusion of the story: "Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself
as a creature driven and derided by vanity: and my eyes burned with
anguish and anger" (Joyce 27). Norris instead interprets the
conclusion as "the creation of a moral fable with a specious moral"
(Norris 54) by the adult-narrator. This is claimed in Norris's
introduction and conclusion, but I didn't find it to be clearly
connected to the textual analysis described above.
