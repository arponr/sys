oh dear child, i love ya,
no not like Lolita,
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya

oh dear, do ya hear me
oh dear, do ya see me
no you're way too busy
too busy being free
too busy being free

i watch you play in the grass
you flail around with such class
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass

* * *

dark dark night and cold cold flow
i'm still alone
i guess that's dope
stay on this boat

black black crow in white white snow
i miss you so
i guess that's dope
i'm drifting slow

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far between
stay in the current of time unseen

dark dark stars and cold cold moon
at the break of noon
i'm lost at truth
what's there to do

black black heart in white white dunes
regret accrued
i'm lost at truth
i'll float on through

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far between
stay in the current of time unseen

* * *

i'm naked
on an empty beach
sitting underneath
the relentless sun
of the summer
which has stolen
all the cloud cover
now where
do i hide
faced with this
ominous shoreline

* * *

let the wet sand drip through your hands
lie in wait, in peace, this starless beach
a restful space between the bright, heartless chase
unfurl in muted skies while the sun draws its blinds

everything is static

can you see me
are we pixels
am i in 3d
could you fix me

* * *

good at getting, bad at being inspired
good at feeling, bad at seeing higher
help me filter, let me find her,
this is water, this is water

* * *

chiaroscuro

* * *

go to sleep
you are awake
and dreaming
there's something at stake

go to sleep
you are awake
and dreaming
your problems are real

wake up
your lids are shut
and the warm expanse
is anything but

wake up
your lids are shut
and the warm expanse
will swallow you down

* * *

(the anhedonia)
arrives like lightning
lingers like rain

do the grey skies signify
that i am alive?
why do i need metaphors
just to survive?

i am here here here here here
i wish i didn't know that

* * *

Kissing laguidly, morosely
Naked on pistachio quagmires

remember remember
the night that you chose
to be on your own
it was so dark and so lonely
the birds they did call
ever so softly
so lightly and sweetly
like the rain
dripping lightly and sweetly
it was so dark and so lonely

remember remember
the life that you chose
to be on your own
it was so dark and so lonely
the years they did fall
ever so softly
so lightly and sweetly
like the rain
dripping lightly and sweetly
it was so dark and so lonely

do not deduce yourself
out of the truth

* * *

turn around and you will see
that we were never even free
we're just another
giant bird conspiracy
sitting atop the world
mind unfurled, wings unfold
shadows telling stories that we've told

* * *

the world is always ending
isn't that comforting

* * *

like good wine
with age i grow
more bitter
more a waste of your time

more rotten
have you forgotten
free of pretension

* * *

i didn't know what to say
when i saw your face in my brain
i didn't know who to be
when you came to me in my sleep
i didn't know what was real
with these strange things you made me feel

the door flies open, you're here unannounced
and without a word you come in and pounce
and it all happened so silently
i became your king and you my queen
we should stay right here till the end of time
and stop asking who or what, where, when or why

i'm tired and slipping from my chair
but i turn around and somehow you're there
i think you're talking but i can't hear
with this goddamn heart living in my ear
i lunge and kiss you and we are one
and you pull the air right from my lungs

with eyes wide shut i approach you
and wonder out loud what i should do
and time begins to fade and blur
i wade into my heart and wait for her
will it all turn out just like i dreamed
looking back at the shore as i'm carried out to sea

* * *

'fuck the world' said the nihilist pansexual
who needs a girl when i do just fine on my own
'why give a fuck at all' said the indifferent asexual
who would want a girl when you can do so much on your own

'what in god's name is a shawl' said the stubbornly unfashionable
who would want a girl when you can get dressed on your own

'even if they existed there could be no two like souls', he said, oh so rational
who needs a girl when things make sense on your own
'anyway it's all biological' said the cold intellectual
who would want a girl when it's twice as simple on your own

i say these things with a wink
and half-believe that i'll transcend
but i'm now starting to think
it'd be nice to have a lifelong friend

just one lifelong friend
to hold and help me pretend
things'll be fine, all right
at least till i'm dead

* * *

i'm so fucking vain
and so full of shame
will it always be the same
let's get rid of these names

i'm literally looking at my face
as i write this chord / discord

* * *

i'm losing my breath
just keeping up with time
missing entire phases
trying to keep things sublime

* * *

every decade love grows more painful

* * *

look at all the symbols and abstraction dissolve
it's just you upon me upon you
convincing each other of our unquestionable resolve

* * *

i felt my spine curve around your warmth
and become cold
and i could imagine us painted just as two lines
intertwined, becoming old

i won't forget those five nights in my bed
before you left to see the world

the moment you held me i unfurled
and was born again inside you girl
lost forever inside your swirl
these axioms are now so unsure

* * *

this is a waste of fucking time
why have i sought to be alone
when i could have been alone with you

i wish we were trees caressing each other's leaves
till the end of earth
from you emerged the above haiku, do you see
how i crumbled the moment you held me

* * *

can you imagine seeing everything in front of you in perfect clarify and having to lay perfectly still
i'm at the brink of fainting
for every detail and moment excrutiates me

i fear true love and other outcomes
and the power of being held by someone

* * *

why
did we have to die
well i'll see you on the other side
the sixteenth of july

six feet beneath the sky
the heat blurring the sunrise
i'm laying at the feet of flies
decaying at the hands of time

* * *
