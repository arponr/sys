oh dear child, i love ya,
no not like Lolita,
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya

oh dear, do ya hear me
oh dear, do ya see me
no you're way too busy
too busy being free
too busy being free

i watch you play in the grass
you flail around with such class
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass

----------------------------------------

dark dark night and cold cold flow
i'm still alone
i guess that's dope
stay on this boat

black black crow in white white snow
i miss you so
i guess that's dope
i'm drifting slow

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far
  between
stay in the current of time unseen

dark dark stars and cold cold moon
at the break of noon
i'm lost at truth
what's there to do

black black heart in white white dunes
regret accrued
i'm lost at truth
i'll float on through

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far
  between
stay in the current of time unseen

----------------------------------------

i'm naked
on an empty beach
sitting underneath
the relentless sun
of the summer
which has stolen
all the cloud cover
now where
do i hide
faced with this
ominous shoreline

----------------------------------------

let the wet sand drip through your hands
lie in wait, in peace, this starless
  beach
a restful space between the bright,
  heartless chase
unfurl in muted skies while the sun
  draws its blinds

everything is static

can you see me
are we pixels
am i in 3d
could you fix me

----------------------------------------

good at getting, bad at being inspired
good at feeling, bad at seeing higher
help me filter, let me find her,
this is water, this is water

----------------------------------------

chiaroscuro


----------------------------------------


go to sleep
you are awake
and dreaming
there's something at stake

go to sleep
you are awake
and dreaming
your problems are real

wake up
your lids are shut
and the warm expanse
is anything but

wake up
your lids are shut
and the warm expanse
will swallow you down

----------------------------------------

arrives like lightning
lingers like rain

do the grey skies signify
that i am alive?
why do i need metaphors
just to survive?

i am here here here here here
i wish i didn't know that

----------------------------------------
