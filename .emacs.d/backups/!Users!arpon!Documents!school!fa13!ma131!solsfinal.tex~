\section{Normalisers}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We first claim $H \subseteq N_G(H)$. Let $h \in H$. Since $H$ is a
subgroup, for all $k \in H$ we have $h k h^{-1} \in H$ and $h^{-1} k h
\in H$. Since $h(h^{-1} k h) h^{-1} = k$, it follows that $hHh^{-1} =
H$, proving the claim. That $H$ is in fact a normal subgroup of
$N_G(H)$ is immediate from the definition of $N_G(H)$.

\medskip
Now let $G \coloneqq D_8$ and $H \coloneqq \langle f \rangle$. Since
$f^2 = \id_G$ we have $H = \{\id_G, f\}$. Thus
\begin{align*}
  g \in N_G(H) &\iff \{g \id_G g^{-1}, g f g^{-1}\} = \{\id_G, f\}
  \iff \{\id_G, g f g^{-1}\} = \{\id_G, f\} \\ &\iff g f g^{-1} = f
\end{align*}
for $g \in G$. By the relations defining $G$, any $g \in G$ can be
written uniquely as $r^if^j$ where $0 \le i \le 3$ and $0 \le j \le
1$, whence
\[
gfg^{-1} = (r^if^j)f(f^{-j}r^{-i}) = r^i f r^{-i} = r^{2i} f.
\]
Since $r^{2i} = \id_G$ precisely when $i \in \{0,2\}$ it follows that
$N_G(H) = \{\id_G, f, r^2, r^2f\}$. Then it's clear that $N_G(H)/H =
\{[\id_G], [r^2]\}$, where $[{-}]$ denotes the corresponding coset of
$H$.

\section{Cayley graph for $D_8$}

\subsection*{(i)}

As in the case of $D_6 \simeq S_3$ we discussed in lecture, the
covering space $E$ corresponding to $\phi : F_2 \to D_8$ is the Cayley
graph of $D_8$ with generators $r,f$, pictured below. (Here red arrows
correspond to $r$ and blue to $f$.)

\usetikzlibrary{decorations.markings}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows,positioning}

\tikzset{
  ->-/.style={decoration={markings,
      mark=at position .5 with {\arrow{>}}},postaction={decorate}},
  nd/.style = {circle,fill=black,inner sep=1.5pt},
  redarr/.style={->-, red, fill=none,>=stealth},
  bluarr/.style={->-,blue,fill=none,>=stealth}
}

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[nd] (otl) at (0,0) [label=left:$f$] {};
    \node[nd] (itl) [below right=of otl, label=left:$\id$] {};
    \node[nd] (itr) [right=of itl, label=right:$r$] {};
    \node[nd] (otr) [above right=of itr, label=right:$rf$] {};
    \node[nd] (ibl) [below=of itl, label=left:$r^3$] {};
    \node[nd] (obl) [below left=of ibl, label=left:$r^3f$] {};
    \node[nd] (ibr) [right=of ibl, label=right:$r^2$] {};
    \node[nd] (obr) [below right=of ibr, label=right:$r^2f$] {};

    \draw[redarr] (otr) to (otl);
    \draw[redarr] (otl) to (obl);
    \draw[redarr] (obl) to (obr);
    \draw[redarr] (obr) to (otr);
    \draw[redarr] (itl) to (itr);
    \draw[redarr] (itr) to (ibr);
    \draw[redarr] (ibr) to (ibl);
    \draw[redarr] (ibl) to (itl);

    \draw[bluarr] (ibl) to [bend left = 15] (obl);
    \draw[bluarr] (obl) to [bend left = 15] (ibl);
    \draw[bluarr] (itl) to [bend left = 15] (otl);
    \draw[bluarr] (otl) to [bend left = 15] (itl);
    \draw[bluarr] (ibr) to [bend left = 15] (obr);
    \draw[bluarr] (obr) to [bend left = 15] (ibr);
    \draw[bluarr] (itr) to [bend left = 15] (otr);
    \draw[bluarr] (otr) to [bend left = 15] (itr);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

\subsection*{(ii)}

Also analogous to the case of $D_6 \simeq S_3$, the covering space
$E'$ corresponding to $\phi^{-1}(\langle f \rangle)$ is given by
quotienting the Cayley graph from (i) by the action of $\langle f
\rangle$, that is, by left-multiplication by $f$. This gives us the
following graph.

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[nd] (tl) at (0,0) [label=left:$\id$] {};
    \node[nd] (tr) [right=of tl, label=right:$r$] {};
    \node[nd] (bl) [below=of tl, label=left:$r^3$] {};
    \node[nd] (br) [right=of bl, label=right:$r^2$] {};

    \draw[redarr] (tl) to (tr);
    \draw[redarr] (tr) to (br);
    \draw[redarr] (br) to (bl);
    \draw[redarr] (bl) to (tl);

    \draw[bluarr] (tr) to [bend left = 15] (bl);
    \draw[bluarr] (bl) to [bend left = 15] (tr);
    \draw[bluarr] (tl) to [out=60,in=120,looseness=20] (tl);
    \draw[bluarr] (br) to [out=240,in=300,looseness=20] (br);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

\subsection*{(iii)}

Recall a Galois automorphism is determined uniquely by where it sends
any point. Let's consider the vertex $\id$ in $E'$ above. Its $f$ loop
must be sent to an $f$ loop, so the only vertex it can be sent to is
$r^2$. And indeed rotation by $\pi$, which of course has order $2$,
gives such a automorphism. Thus this and the identity are the two
elements of $\Gal(E'/B)$.

\section{$F_n$ as a subgroup of $F_2$}

Alex likes graphs, so here's a fun geometric solution.

\medskip
Recall the following facts:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $p : (E,e) \to (B,b)$ is a covering, $\pi_1(E,e) \simeq
  p_*\pi_1(E,e) \subseteq \pi_1(B,b)$.
\item The fundamental group of a graph $G$ is a free group on
  $|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1$ generators.
\end{itemize}
Since $\pi_1(S_1 \vee S_1) \simeq F_2$, if we can show a covering
graph $G$ of $S^1\vee S^1$ with $|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1=n$, we'll be done.

\medskip
Now consider the covering space $G_n$ of $S^1\vee S^1$ obtained by a
directed $a$ cycle with $n-1$ vertices that overlaps with a directed
$b$ cycle with $n-1$ vertices, for all $n\geq3$. This space is
illustrated below in the cases of $n=4$ (here red arrows correspond to
$a$ and blue to $b$):

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[nd] (l) at (0,0) {};
  \node[nd] (r) at (2,0) {};
  \node[nd] (t) at (1,1.73) {};

  \draw[bluarr] (r) to [in=30, out=150] (l);
  \draw[bluarr] (t) to [in=150, out=270] (r);
  \draw[bluarr] (l) to [in=270, out=30] (t);
  \draw[redarr] (l) to [in=-150, out=-30] (r);
  \draw[redarr] (r) to [in=330, out=90] (t);
  \draw[redarr] (t) to [in=90, out=210] (l);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

Observe that
\[
|E(G_n)|-|V(G_n)|+1=2(n-1)-(n-1)+1=n,
\]
so $\pi_1(G_n) \simeq F_n$, as desired. Note thatthe generating set of
loops for $\pi_1(G_n) \simeq F_n$ maps to a generating set of loops
for $F_n \subseteq \pi_1(S^1\vee S^1) \simeq F_2$.

\medskip
So pick some base point $e_n\in G_n$ and consider a spanning tree
$T_n\subseteq G_n$ that consists of going counterclockwise along an
$a$ edge $n-2$ times (notice that $G_n$ has $n-1$ vertices, so the
tree has $n-2$ edges). Recall that $T_n$ is deformation retractable to
$e_n$, and this deformation retract induces a homotopy equivalence
between $G_n$ and a bouquet of $n$ circles wedged together at
$e_n$. It's easy to see that the paths in $G_n$ that are homotopy
equivalent to the $n$ circles are given by the following $n$ loops
based at $e_n$ in $G_n$:
\begin{align*}
	&a*b \\ &a*a*b*a^{-1}, \\ &\vdots \\ &\underbrace{a*\ldots
    *a}_{n-2}b\underbrace{a^{-1}*\ldots *a^{-1}}_{n-3},
  \\ &\underbrace{a*\ldots *a}_{n-1}, \\ &\underbrace{a*\ldots
    *a}_{n-2}*b^{-1}
\end{align*}
The above generating set of $F_n$ maps to a generating set of $F_n$ as
a subgroup of $F_2$, given by
\begin{align*}
  S=\{ab, a^2ba^{-1},\ldots,
  a^{n-2}ba^{-(n-3)},a^{n-1},a^{n-2}b^{-1}\}.
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Isometries and free products}

It suffices to show that there is no relation between $a$ and $b$
except for $a^2=b^2=\id_G$. So, assume that
\[
a^{n_1}b^{m_2}\ldots a^{n_k}b^{m_k}=\id_G
\]
for some integers $n_i,m_i$. Since $a^2=b^2=\id_G$, we can assume
without loss of generality $n_i\in\{0,1\},m_i\in\{0,1\} $. Thus, we
have four cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\underbrace{ab\ldots ab}_{n}=\id_G$ for some $n>0$. Observe
  that $ab:x\to x-1$. Thus, $x-n=x$ for all $x\in\R$, which is a
  contradiction.
\item $\underbrace{ab\ldots ab}_{n}a=\id_G$ for some $n\geq0$. This
  means that $-x-n=x$ for all $x\in\R$, which is a contradiction
  again.
\item The other two cases can be deduced in a similar manner.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Galois groups more generally}

This is just [Munkres, Theorem 81.2]. (Sorry Arpon is such a bad CA,
but he's a bit pressed for time.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Degree 5 Galois covers of $S^1\vee S^1$}

Recall the following facts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of reasonable Galois covering spaces of $S^1\vee S^1$ with
  Galois group $G$ is in bijection with the set of kernels of
  surjective homomorphisms $\psi:F_2\to G$.
\item For a connected Galois covering space $p:(E,e)\to (B,b)$, the
  Galois group $\Gal(E/B)$ is in bijection with the fiber $p^{-1}(b)$
\end{itemize}

Thus, since we're looking for degree 5 covers and 5 is prime, the
Galois group can only be $\Z_5$. So we want to count the number of
different subgroups of $F_2$ which arise as kernels of surjective
homomorphisms $\psi:F_2\to \Z_5$.

\medskip
Now, identify $\Z_5=\{0,\ldots,4\}$. Every such homomorphism is
uniquely determined by where it sends the generators $a$ and
$b$. Moreover, observe that postcomposing $\psi$ with an automorphism
of $\Z_5$ gives us a different homomorphism, but leaves the kernel the
same, since every automorphism of $\Z_5$ fixes $0$. Hence, without
loss of generality, $\psi$ sends $a$ to either $0$ or $1$, and if it
sends $a$ to $0$, it sends $b$ to $1$. Thus, there are several cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\psi(a)=1,\psi(b)=j$ for $j\in\Z_5$. The kernel is determined
  by the condition
  \begin{align*}
    &\psi(a^{n_1}b^{m_1}\ldots a^{n_k}b^{m_k})=0
    \\
    &\iff \sum_{i=1}^k n_i+j\sum_{i=1}^k m_i \equiv 0 (\text{mod }5)
  \end{align*}
  Clearly, for different $j$ we get different kernels.
\item $\psi(a)=0,\psi(b)=1$. The kernel is determined by the condition
  \begin{align*}
    &\psi(a^{n_1}b^{m_1}\ldots a^{n_k}b^{m_k})=0
    \\
    &\iff \sum_{i=1}^k m_i \equiv 0 (\text{mod }5)
  \end{align*}
  which is different from the kernels in the above case.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, the number of regular connected 5-covers of $S^1\vee S^1$ is 6.

\section{$S^1\vee S^1 \inj S^1\times S^1$}

\subsection*{(i)}

Observe that if we take the image of the boundary of the square under
the standard quotient map $p:I^2\to \R^2/\Z^2$, we get two circles
glued together at a single point (the common image of the four
vertices of the square). This gives us a natural homeomorphism from
$S^1\vee S^1$ to $p(\partial I^2)\subseteq \pi(I^2)=\R^2/\Z^2$.

\subsection*{(ii)}

Suppose that there is a retraction $r:\R^2/\Z^2\to p(\partial I^2)$,
and let $i:p(\partial I^2)\hookrightarrow \R^2/\Z^2$ be the canonical
inclusion. Then, since $r$ is a retraction, $r\circ i$ is the identity
on $p(\partial I^2)$. Consequently, $(r\circ i)_* = r_*\circ i_*$ is
the identity on $\pi_1(p(\partial I^2))=F_2$, which means that the
identity homomorphism on $F_2$ factors through
$\pi_1(R^2/\Z^2)=\Z^2$. In particular, the homomorphism $i_*$ is
injective. However

  \begin{lemma}
    There is no injective homomorphism $\psi:G\to H$ when $G$ is
    nonabelian and $H$ is abelian.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $\psi:G\to H$ be a homomorphism, and let $a,b\in G$ be such
    that $ab\neq ba$. Then,
    \begin{align*}
      \psi(ab) = \psi(a)\psi(b)=\psi(b)\psi(a)=\psi(ba)
    \end{align*}
    so $\psi$ fails to be injective.
  \end{proof}

\section{$S^1\vee S^1$ is a torus with one point removed}

The point of the last problem was to give you a little hint of how
this one might work. There, there was no retraction of the torus onto
the image of the boundary of $I^2$; but in this case, it is easy to
see that the torus without a point in fact deformation retracts to
$S^1\vee S^1$.

\medskip
Probably the easiest way to convince yourself of this is by looking at
the gluing diagram. Without loss of generality, the missing point is
the center of the square (why?). Then, we can expand this point to a
continuously increasing square-shaped hole with sides parallel to the
sides of $I^2$ and centered at the center of $I^2$, until we are left
with the boundary. One can easily write down a concrete expression for
this transformation, from which it is obvious that it is continuous.

\medskip
Let $a=(1/2,1/2)\in I^2$. Thus, $I^2-a$ deformation retracts to its
boundary via some continuous homotopy $H:[0,1]\times (I^2-a)\to
(I^2-a)$. Let $p:I^2\to\R^2/\Z^2$ be the standard quotient map that
gives us the torus; then, it restricts to a quotient map $p:I^2-a\to
\R^2/\Z^2-p(a)$. It is easy to see that $p\circ H$ is constant on
fibers of $\id\times p$, since the boundary $\partial I^2$ is fixed
throughout the homotopy $H$.

\medskip
Finally, $\id\times p$ is a quotient map, by the following general
fact from Munkres:

\begin{lemma}[Munkres, Exercise 29.11]
  If $p:X\to Y$ is a quotient map, and $Z$ is locally compact and
  Hausdorff, then $p\times \id_Z: X\times Z\to Y\times Z$ is a
  quotient map.
\end{lemma}

Indeed, in our case $Z=[0,1]$ has the required properties (and perhaps
it's not hard to see that the map in question is a quotient map from
first principles). Hence, by the universal property of the quotient,
we have a map $h$ that makes the below diagram commute:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
I\times (I^2-a) \arrow[two heads]{d}{\id\times p} \arrow{r}{p\circ H}
& \R^2/\Z^2-p(a) \\ I\times(\R^2/\Z^2-a)\arrow{ur}{h}&
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Since $H$ is a deformation retract, $h$ is also a deformation retract;
finally, observe that the subspace to which $\R^2/\Z^2-p(a)$ retracts
to is exactly the image of the boundary $\partial I^2$, which is
homeomorphic to $S^1\vee S^1$.

\section{Continuation of 11.3}

Thanks to Nat Mayer for writing good solutions to this one. For $(x,y)
\in \R^2$ denote by $L(x,y)$ the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$.

\subsection*{(i)}

It suffices to show the segment $L(q,p)$ is a fundamental domain for
the line $px = qy$ (since the boundary points are clearly identified,
this then gives a circle on the torus). Suppose we have $(x,y),
(x',y')$ on the line with $(x-x',y-y') = (n,m) \in \Z^2$. Then we must
have $pn = qm$, and since $p,q$ are relatively prime, this occurs if
and only if $n = kq$ and $m = kp$ for some $k \in \Z$. It's clear then
the orbit of $(0,0)$ intersects the segment only at the boundary, and
all orbits intersect the segment precisely once, as desired.

\subsection*{(ii)}

Let $a,b \in \Z$ such that $ap + bq = 1$. Define the linear map $F :
\R^2 \to \R^2$ by $F(x,y) = (px - qy, bx + ay)$, so $\det(F) =
1$. From problem 3 from last week, $F$ is the lift of a homeomorphism
$f : T \to T$. Clearly $F$ takes the line segment $L(q,p)$ to
$L(0,1)$, whence $f$ takes $C(p,q)$ to $C(1,0)$.

\subsection*{(iii)}

Applying the homeomorphism $f$ from (ii) doesn't change the number of
intersections so it suffices to find the number of intersections of
$C(1,0)$ and $C(as+br,ps-qr)$. Lifting to the fundamental domains
described in (i), it suffices to find the number of intersections of
$L(ps-qr,as+br) - \{(ps-qr,as+br)\}$ with the $\Z^2$-translates of the
$y$-axis, i.e., the numer of integer $x$-coordinates achieved. It's
easy to see that as long as $ps-qr \ne 0$, this is precisely $|ps - qr|$.

\end{document}
