\subsection*{Sheaf}

The identity axiom is obvious since the nontrivial restriction maps
are injective, so we just need to verify the gluing axiom. Let
$\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a collection of open sets in $P$, and write
$U_i = P - Q_i$. Then $\bigcup U_i = P - \bigcap Q_i$. Suppose we are
given $f_i \in \F(U_i)$ for $i \in I$ which are consistent on
intersections. Then by definition of the restriction maps we must have
\[
\textstyle{f_i = f \in \bigcap \Z[\{1/q\}_{q \in Q_i}] = \Z[\{1/q\}_{q
    \in \bigcap Q_i}] \subseteq \Q}
\]
for all $i \in I$. Then $f \in \F(\bigcup U_i)$ gives the necessary
section which restricts to $f_i$ on each $U_i$.

\subsection*{Stalk}

The stalk $\F_p$ is the localisation of $\Z$ at $(p)$:
\[
\F_p \simeq \colim_{U \ni p} \F(U) \simeq \colim_{Q \not\ni p}
\Z[\{1/q\}_{q \in Q}] \simeq \Z[\{1/q\}_{q \ne p}] \simeq \Z_{(p)}.
\]

\subsection*{Connectedness}

We claim $|\F|$ is indeed path-connected. Let $\phi,\psi \in |\F|$ be
any two points, say over $x,y \in \R$ respectively. As stated in
[Forster, Ch. 1, 7.1--7.2], giving a path from $\phi$ to $\psi$ is
equivalent to giving a path $u : [0,1] \to \R$ from $x$ to $y$ along
with $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_{n-1} < t_n = 1$ and $f_i \in
\F(U_i)$ with $u([t_{i-1},t_i]) \subseteq U_i$ for $1 \le i \le n$
such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(f_1)_x = \phi$ and $(f_n)_y = \psi$;
\item $f_i|_{V_i} = f_{i+1}|_{V_i}$ where $V_i$ is the connected
  component of $U_i \cap U_{i+1}$ containing $u(t_i)$.
\end{enumerate}
We can construct $U_i \ce (a_i,b_i)$ and $f_i \in \F(U_i)$ as
follows. Choose $(a_1,b_1) \ni x$ and $(a_4,b_4) \ni y$ such that
there exist $f_1 \in \F(U_1)$ and $f_4 \in \F(U_4)$ for which $(f_1)_x
= \phi$ and $(f_4)_y = \psi$. Let $a_2 \in (a_1, b_1)$, $a_3 \in (a_4,
b_4)$ and $b_2 = b_3 > \max(b_1, b_6) + 1$. Let $f_2 \in \F(U_2)$
agree with $f_1$ on $(a_2,b_1)$, linear from $f_1(b_1)$ to $(f_1(b_1)
+ f_4(b_4))/2$ on $[b_1,b_2-1]$ and constant on
$[b_2-1,b_2)$. Similarly define $f_3 \in \F(U_3)$ with respect to
$f_4$. This clearly gives us the necessary data. A picture
illustrating the construction is to the side.

\subsection*{Countability}

We claim $|\F|$ is not second-countable. If it were, then there would
be a countable set of opens $\{[U_i,f_i]\}_{i \in \N}$ such that any
open $[U,f]$ contains some $[U_i,f_i]$. Note $[U,f] \supseteq [V,g]$
if and only if $U \supseteq V$ and $f|_V = g$. But the functions
$x^\epsilon$ for $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ all have different germs at
$0$. Since $(0,1)$ is uncountable it cannot be true for all $\epsilon
\in (0,1)$ that $[(-1,1), x^\epsilon] \supseteq [U_i,f_i]$ for some $i
\in \N$.

\prob{5}

Let $t$ be the complex coordinate on $U$. Let $p \ce \chi(t)$, so that
$t - p \in \ker(\chi)$. We must have $p \in U$, or else $t - p$ would
be a unit in $\O(U)$ and hence could not be in $\ker(\chi)$. For any
$f \in \O(U)$ we can write $f = f(p) + (t-p)g$ with $g \in
\O(U)$. (Away from $p$ we can define $g \ce (f-f(p))/(t-p)$, and $g$
is defined on a neighbourhood of $p$ via the power series expansion of
$f$ at $p$.) Then clearly $\chi(f) = f(p)$.

\prob{6}

The claim is true. For $i \in \{1,2\}$ let $(X_i,f_i)$ be an extension
of $(X_0,f_0)$ given by an embedding $j_i : X_0 \to X_i$. Then we can
form the pushout $(X_3,f_3) \ce (X_1 \amalg_{X_0} X_2, f_1
\amalg_{f_0} f_2)$ extending both $f_1$ and $f_2$. The fact that we
can take the pushout in the category of Riemann surfaces is clear from
the point of view of locally ringed spaces, simply by gluing structure
sheaves. I.e., we define $\O_3 \ce \O_1 \times_{\O_0} \O_2$, where
$\O_i$ is the structure sheaf of $X_i$.
