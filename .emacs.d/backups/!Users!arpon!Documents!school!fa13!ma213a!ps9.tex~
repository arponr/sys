\prob{1}

Let $u$ be defined on $U \supset \oline\Delta$ open in $\C$. Since $u$
is harmonic there exists $h : U \to \C$ holomorphic such that $u =
\Re(h)$. Let $f \coloneqq e^h : U \to \C$. Then $f$ is holomorphic and
clearly vanishes nowhere on $U$, so the Poisson-Jensen formula gives
that, for $z \in \Delta$,
\[
\log(|f(z)|) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \Re\left( \frac{e^{i\phi}
  + z}{e^{i\phi} - z} \right) \log(|f(e^{i\phi})|) \,d\phi.
\]
Note that $\log(|f(z)|) = \Re(h(z)) = u(z)$ for $z \in U$. Now for $0
< r \le 1$ and $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$,
\begin{align*}
  2\Re\left( \frac{e^{i\phi} + re^{i\theta}}{e^{i\phi} - re^{i\theta}}
  \right) &= \frac{e^{i\phi} + re^{i\theta}}{e^{i\phi} - re^{i\theta}}
  + \frac{e^{-i\phi} + re^{-i\theta}}{e^{-i\phi} - re^{-i\theta}} =
  \frac{1 + re^{i(\theta-\phi)}}{1 - re^{i(\theta-\phi)}} + \frac{1 +
    re^{-i(\theta-\phi)}}{1 - re^{-i(\theta-\phi)}} \\ &=
  \frac{2(1-r^2)}{1 - 2r\cos(\theta-\phi) + r^2}.
\end{align*}
Combining the above gives that
\[
u(re^{i\theta}) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} u(e^{i\phi})
\frac{1-r^2}{1 - 2r\cos(\theta-\phi) + r^2} \,d\phi,
\]
as desired. \win

\prob{2}

\subprob{a}

We will use tildes to denote the relevant quantities for $f(z^2)$. For
sufficiently large $r$ and all $\epsilon > 0$ we have
\[
\tilde M(r) = M(r^2) \le \exp((r^2)^{\lambda + \epsilon}) =
\exp(r^{2\lambda + 2\epsilon}),
\]
implying $\tilde\lambda \le 2\lambda$. Conversely,
\[
M(r) = \tilde M(r^{1/2}) \le \exp((r^{1/2})^{\tilde\lambda +
  \epsilon}) = \exp(r^{\tilde\lambda/2 + \epsilon/2}),
\]
so $\lambda \le \tilde\lambda / 2$. Thus in fact $\tilde\lambda =
2\lambda$.

Now, writing $f$ as its product expansion we have
\[
f(z^2) = e^{p(z^2)} z^{2m} \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left(\left( 1 -
\frac{z^2}{z_k} \right) \exp\left( \sum_{i=1}^h \frac{1}{i} \left(
\frac{z^2}{z_k} \right)^i \right) \right),
\]
where $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $d$ and the genus of $f$ is $g
= \max(d, h)$. Now factor $(1 - z^2/z_k)$ as $(1 - z/\sqrt{z_k})(1 +
z/\sqrt{z_k})$ and observe
\[
\sum_{i=1}^h \frac{1}{i} \left( \frac{z^2}{z_k} \right)^i =
\sum_{i=1}^{2h+1} \frac{1}{i} \left( \left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{z_k}}\right)^i
+ \left(\frac{z}{-\sqrt{z_k}}\right)^i \right).
\]
Next note that
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left( |\sqrt{z_k}|^{-2h-2} +
|{-\sqrt{z_k}}|^{-2h-2} \right) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty |z_k|^{-h-1},
\]
so the left-hand side converges if and only if the right-hand side
does. Finally since $p(z^2)$ of course has degree $2d$, it follows
that $\tilde g \in \{2g, 2g+1\}$. By Hadamard's theorem we have that
\[
g \le \lambda \le g + 1, \quad \tilde g \le \tilde \lambda = 2\lambda
\le \tilde g + 1.
\]
We thus have the following possibilities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $g \le \lambda < g + 1/2$ then $\tilde g = 2g$.
\item If $g + 1/2 = \lambda$ then $\tilde g \in \{2g, 2g+1\}$.
\item If $g + 1/2 < \lambda \le g + 1$ then $\tilde g = 2g+1$. \win
\end{enumerate}

\subprob{b}

It's clear from the product expansion that $\cos(z)$ has genus
$1$. And from $\cos(z) = (e^{iz} - e^{-iz})/2$ it's clear it has order
at most $1$; by Hadamard's theorem it must have order precisely $1$
then. The above gives then that $\cos(\sqrt{z})$ has order $1/2$ and
genus $0$.

The same analysis shows that $\sin(z)$ has genus and order $1$. The
above gives then that $\sin(z^2)$ has genus and order $2$.

Finally, since squaring a product expansion does not change the degree
of the polynomial in the exponent and simply has the effect of
doubling each zero, it's clear that $\sin^2(z)$ has genus equal to
that of $\sin(z)$, that is, $1$. And since
\[
\log(\log(M_{\sin^2}(r))) = \log(\log(M_{\sin}(r)^2)) =
\log(\log(M_{\sin}(r))) + \log(2),
\]
it's clear that $\sin^2(z)$ has order equal to $\sin(z)$, that is,
$1$.

\prob{3}

Let $f : \C \to \C$ entire of genus $0$ or $1$. Then by definition we
can write
\[
f(z) = e^{az+b} z^m \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left(\left( 1 - \frac{z}{z_k}
\right) e^{\epsilon z/z_k}\right),
\]
where $\epsilon \in \{0,1\}$. If $f$ has zeros only on the real line
then of course we have $z_k \in \R$ for $k \in \N$. If furthermore $f$
is real-valued on the real line, it follows immediately that $a \in
\R$.

Now let $z \notin \R$. Then $f(z) \ne 0$ so
\[
\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = a + \frac{m}{z} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\left(\frac{1}{z-z_k} + \frac{\epsilon}{z_k}\right)
\]
Observe that for $t \in \R$ we have $\Im(1/(z-t)) =
-\Im(z)/|z-t|^2$. It follows immediately that
\[
\Im\left(\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\right) = m\Im\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) +
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \Im\left(\frac{1}{z-z_k}\right) = - q \Im(z)
\]
for some $q > 0$. This of course implies $f'(z) \ne 0$. \win
