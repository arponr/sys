desc: Some basic facts about finitely presented modules and algebras.
---

We recall the definitions and prove two basic lemmas about finite
presentation, that "finitely presented implies always finitely
presented"[^always] and that it is a local property. The proofs in the
setting of modules and in the setting of algebras are completely
analogous, so we will abstract very slightly and address both at once.

Our notation is as follows:

- All rings and algebras are commutative with unit.
- Let $$A$$ be a ring throughout.
- Let $$\mc{C}$$ denote either the category of $$A$$-modules or the
  category of $$A$$-algebras. All arrows indicate morphisms in
  $$\mc{C}$$.
- Let $$\amalg$$ denote the coproduct in $$\mc{C}$$, i.e., direct sum
  $$\oplus$$ for $$A$$-modules or tensor product $$\otimes_A$$ for
  $$A$$-algebras.
- For $$C \in \ob(\mc{C})$$ and $$n \in \bb{N}$$ let $$C^{\amalg n}$$
  denote the $$n$$-fold coproduct $$C \amalg \cdots \amalg C$$ and
  $$C^n$$ denote the $$n$$-fold product $$C \times \cdots \times C$$.
- Let $$F \in \ob(\mc{C})$$ denote the free object on one element,
  i.e., $$F \simeq A$$ for $$A$$-modules and $$F \simeq A[t]$$ for
  $$A$$-algebras. Thus for any $$n \in \bb{N}$$ there is an
  isomorphism $$\hom_{\mc{C}}(F^{\amalg n},C) \simeq C^n$$ natural in
  $$C \in \ob(\mc{C})$$.

Now to the content.

**Definition.**
An object $$C \in \ob(\mc{C})$$ is:

1. *finitely generated* if for some $$n \in \bb{N}$$ there is a
   surjection $$F^{\amalg n} \to M$$;
2. *finitely presented* if for some $$n \in \bb{N}$$ there is a
   surjection $$F^{\amalg n} \to M$$ with finitely generated kernel.

**Lemma.**
*Let $$f \c C \to D$$ and $$g \c D \to E$$ be morphisms in $$\mc{C}$$.
Define $$h \ce g \circ f$$. Then if $$f$$ is surjective, the canonical
morphism $$\ker(h) \to \ker(g)$$ induced by $$f$$ is surjective. In
particular, if $$\ker(h)$$ is finitely generated then so is
$$\ker(g)$$.*

*Proof.*
Evident.

**Lemma** (Finitely presented implies always finitely presented)**.**
*Let $$C \in \ob(\mc{C})$$ be finitely presented. If $$\alpha \c D \to
C$$ is a surjection with $$D$$ finitely generated, then
$$\ker(\alpha)$$ is finitely generated.*

*Proof.*
By the previous lemma we may assume $$D \simeq F^{\amalg m}$$. By
definition we have a surjection $$\beta \c F^{\amalg n} \to C$$ with
$$\ker(\beta)$$ finitely generated. Consider the diagram

$$
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix {
 & F^{\amalg m} \ar@{>>}[dr]^\alpha & \\
 F^{\amalg m} \oplus A^n \ar@{>>}[ur]^{\id_{F^{\amalg m}} \oplus \xi}
 \ar@{>>}[dr]_{\eta \oplus \id_{A^n}} \ar@{>>}[rr]^-\gamma & & M, \\
 & A^n \ar@{>>}[ur]_\beta &
}
\end{xy}
$$

where $$\xi \c A^n \to F^{\amalg m}$$ and $$\eta \c F^{\amalg m} \to A^n$$ are defined
such that $$\alpha \circ \xi = \beta$$ and $$\beta \circ \eta =
\alpha$$ (which exist since frees are projective), so that defining
$$\gamma \ce \alpha \oplus \beta$$ makes the diagram commute. Now, if
$$\{e_1,\ldots,e_m\}$$ is the canonical basis of $$F^{\amalg m}$$ then clearly
$$\ker(\gamma)$$ is generated by $$\ker(\beta)$$ and $$\{e_i -
\eta(e_i)\}_{1 \le i \le m}$$. Thus $$\ker(\beta)$$ being finitely
generated implies $$\ker(\gamma)$$ is finitely generated, which
implies $$\ker(\alpha)$$ is finitely generated by the previous lemma.



# Algebras

All morphisms in this section are in the category of $$A$$-algebras.

**Definition.**
An $$A$$-algebra $$B$$ is:

1. *finitely generated* if there is a surjection $$A[t_1,\ldots,t_n]
   \to B$$;
2. *finitely presented* if there is a surjection $$A[t_1,\ldots,t_n]
   \to B$$ with finitely generated kernel.

**Lemma.**
*Let $$f \c M_1 \to M_2$$ and $$g \c M_2 \to M_3$$ be morphisms.
Define $$h \ce g \circ f$$. Then if $$f$$ is surjective, the canonical
morphism $$\ker(h) \to \ker(g)$$ induced by $$f$$ is surjective. In
particular if $$\ker(h)$$ is finitely generated then so is
$$\ker(g)$$.*

*Proof.*
Evident. WHAT

**Lemma** (Finitely presented implies always finitely presented)**.**
*Let $$M$$ be a finitely presented $$A$$-module. If $$\alpha \c N \to
M$$ is a surjection with $$N$$ finitely generated, then
$$\ker(\alpha)$$ is finitely generated.*

*Proof.*
By the previous lemma we may assume $$D \simeq F^{\amalg m}$$. By
definition we have a surjection $$\beta \c F^{\amalg n} \to C$$ with
$$\ker(\beta)$$ finitely generated. Consider the diagram

$$
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix {
 & F^{\amalg m} \ar@{>>}[dr]^\alpha & \\
 F^{\amalg m} \oplus F^{\amalg n} \ar@{>>}[ur]^{\id_{F^{\amalg m}}
 \oplus \xi} \ar@{>>}[dr]_{\eta \oplus \id_{F^{\amalg n}}}
 \ar@{>>}[rr]^-\gamma & & C, \\
 & F^{\amalg n} \ar@{>>}[ur]_\beta &
}
\end{xy}
$$

where $$\xi \c F^{\amalg n} \to F^{\amalg m}$$ and $$\eta \c F^{\amalg
m} \to F^{\amalg n}$$ are defined such that $$\alpha \circ \xi =
\beta$$ and $$\beta \circ \eta = \alpha$$ (which exist since frees are
projective), so that defining $$\gamma \ce \alpha \oplus \beta$$ makes
the diagram commute. Now, if $$\{e_1,\ldots,e_m\}$$ is the canonical
basis of $$F^{\amalg m}$$ then clearly $$\ker(\gamma)$$ is generated
by $$\ker(\beta)$$ and $$\{e_i - \eta(e_i)\}_{1 \le i \le m}$$. Thus
$$\ker(\beta)$$ being finitely generated implies $$\ker(\gamma)$$ is
finitely generated, which implies $$\ker(\alpha)$$ is finitely
generated by the previous lemma.
