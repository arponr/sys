\prob{1}

\subprob{a}

Since $xy-zw$ is homogenous of degree $2$ it could only factor
(nontrivially) into two homogenous linear polynomials:
\[
xy-zw = (a_1x+a_2y+a_3z+a_4w)(b_1x+b_2y+b_3z+b_4w).
\]
But then $a_1b_1 = 0$, so $a_1 = 0$ without loss of generality. Then
$a_2b_1 = 1 \implies b_1 \ne 0$, so $a_3b_1 = a_4b_1 = 0 \implies a_3
= a_4 = 0$. But then $y \mid xy - zw \implies y \mid zw$,
contradicting unique factorisation.

On the other hand, in $A(X) := k[x,y,z,w]/(xy - zw)$ we have $xy =
zw$, but $(x) \ne (z)$ and $(x) \ne (w)$ since $(xy - zw)$ contains no
nonzero elements with components of degree $< 2$. Moreover $x,y,z,w$
are clearly irreducible in $A(X)$ by similar degree considerations and
their irreducibility in $k[x,y,z,w]$. Thus $A(X)$ is not a UFD.

\subprob{b}

Let $X := V(xz-y^2, yz-x^3, z^2-x^2y)$. Consider the polynomial (hence
continuous) map $\phi : \A^1 \to \A^3$ sending $t \mapsto
(t,t^2,t^3)$. Clearly $\phi$ is injective. We claim $X =
\im(\phi)$. Since $xz-y^2, yz-x^3, z^2-x^2y$ clearly vanish on
$\im(\phi)$ we have $\im(\phi) \subseteq X$. Conversely, note that
\begin{align*}
y^3 - x^4 &= y(y^2-xz) + x(yz-x^3) \in I(X) \\
z^3 - x^5 &= z(z^2-x^2y) + x^2(yz-x^3) \in I(X) \\
z^4 - y^5 &= z^2(z^2-x^2y) + y(x^2z^2-y^4) \in I(X).
\end{align*}
It follows by the argument from problem 3c on problem set 1 that $X
\subseteq \im(\phi)$. Thus $\phi$ gives a continuous bijection $\A^1
\to X$.\footnote{That only a continuous bijection is necessary was
  pointed out to me by Aaron Landesman.} But then if $X$ is reducible,
that is $X = X_1 \cup X_2$ is a decomposition into proper closeds,
then $\A^1 = \phi^{-1}(X_1) \cup \phi^{-1}(X_2)$ is a decomposition
into proper closeds (by continuity and bijectivity). This contradicts
that $\A^1$ is irreducible, so $X$ must be irreducible.

\subprob{c}

Let $f := \prod_{i=1}^n(t-p_i)$ and $g := \prod_{j=1}^m(t-q_j)$ so
that $\A^1 - \{p_1,\ldots,p_n\} = D(f)$ and $\A^1 - \{q_1,\ldots,q_m\}
= D(g)$. Recall from lecture that
\begin{align*}
\O(D(f)) &\simeq k[t]_f \simeq k[t, (t-p_1)^{-1}, \ldots,
  (t-p_n)^{-1}], \\ \O(D(g)) &\simeq k[t]_g \simeq k[t, (t-q_1)^{-1},
  \ldots, (t-q_m)^{-1}].
\end{align*}
Note that $h \in \O(D(f))$ a unit if and only if $h = c\prod_{i=1}^n
(t-p_i)^{r_i}$, where $c \in k$ and $r_i \in \Z$, and analogously for
$k[t]_g$. Then by unique factorisation we have unit
groups\footnote{The idea to use unique factorisation is due to Rahul
  Dalal.}
\[
\O(D(f))^\times \simeq k \times \Z^n, \quad \O(D(g))^\times \simeq k
\times \Z^m.
\]
If we have an isomorphism $D(f) \simeq D(g)$, then there is an induced
isomorphism $\O(D(f)) \simeq \O(D(g))$ of $k$-algebras. But then by
the above this induces an isomorphism $\Z^n \simeq \Z^m$, whence $n =
m$.

\subprob{d}

Consider the complement of a line, $X := D(f) \subset \A^2$, where $f
\in k[x,y]$ is linear. Then consider the algebraic set $Y := V(zf - 1)
\subset \A^3$. Define a map $\phi : X \to Y$ by $(x,y) \mapsto
(x,y,1/f(x,y))$, and a map $\psi : Y \to X$ by $(x,y,z) \mapsto
(x,y)$. Clearly $\phi,\psi$ are mutually inverse, and regular on
$X,Y$, respectively. Therefore $X \simeq Y$. Moreover we have the
coordinate ring given by
\[
A(Y) \simeq \O(Y) \simeq \O(X) \simeq k[x,y]_f.
\]
Note that $A(Y)$ is then a domain, whence $Y$ is an irreducible
variety.

\prob{2}

\subprob{a}

Observe that $(y/x)^2 - x = y^2/x^2 - x = x^3/x^2 - x = 0$ in the
fraction field of $A$, so $y/x$ is integral over $A$. On the other
hand, suppose we had $f \in k[x,y]$ such that $f^2 - x \in (y^2 -
x^3)$. Clearly $f$ can have no constant term, but then $f^2$ can have
no linear term, a contradiction. Thus $y/x \notin A$.

\subprob{b}

Let $\phi : \A^1 \to X$ the map $t \mapsto (t^3, t^2)$. Since $\phi$
is a polynomial map, $\phi$ is regular, and in particular
continuous. We have an inverse map sending $(x,y) \mapsto x/y$ when $y
\ne 0$ and $(0,0) \mapsto 0$, so $\phi$ is a bijection. Since closed
sets in $\A^1$ are finite unions of points (or the whole space), to
show $\phi^{-1}$ is continuous it suffices to show $\phi^{-1}(t)$ is
closed for $t \in \A^1$. But $\phi$ is a bijection so $\phi^{-1}(t) =
\{a,b\} = V(x-a,y-b)$ is closed. So $\phi$ is a homeomorphism.

But $A(\A^1) = k[t]$ is integrally closed in $k(t)$ and $A(X)$ is not
integrally closed by (a), so $\phi$ cannot be an isomorphism.

\subprob{c}

We note that $y^2-x^3, y^2-x^2(x-1)$ are irreducible without giving
the explicit proof here. Let $I := (y^2-x^3)$ and $J :=
(y^2-x^2(x-1))$. Assume we have inverse isomorphisms $\phi : V(I) \to
V(J)$ and $\psi : V(J) \to V(I)$. As proved in lecture, $\phi, \psi$
must be restrictions of polynomial maps $\A^2 \to \A^2$. Then we have
induced polynomial maps $\phi^*, \psi^* : k[x,y] \to k[x,y]$ inducing
inverse isomorphisms $k[x,y]/J \simeq k[x,y]/I$ of $k$-algebras. I.e.,
$\phi^*$ must send $J$ bijectively to $I$.\footnote{This solution came
  from discussion with Aaron Landesman and Rahul Dalal.}

Then we must have $\psi^*(y^2-x^3) = c(y^2-x^2(x-1))$ for some $0 \ne
c \in k[x,y]$. Then $\phi^*(c)\phi^*(y^2-x^2(x-1)) = y^2-x^3$, and
since $y^2-x^3$ is irreducible and $\phi^*(y^2-x^2(x-1)) \in I$, it
follows that $c \in k$. Now $\psi^*$ is polynomial, so it follows that
we must have $\phi^*(x) = a_1x + a_2$ and $\phi^*(y) =$

\subprob{d}

We claim that it is necessary and sufficient that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item there is root $\zeta \in k$ of $t^2 + 1 \in k[t]$;
\item $\ch(k) \ne 2$.
\end{enumerate}
By the argument from 2c, there is an isomorphism $V(x^2+y^2-1) \to
V(xy-1)$ and only if there is a polynomial map $\phi : k[x,y] \to
k[x,y]$ sending $x^2+y^2-1 \mapsto xy-1$.
