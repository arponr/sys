\section{Affine varieties}

\begin{nothing}
  (a) We have $A(Y) \simeq k[x,y]/(y-x^2)$. The maps $k[x,y]/(y-x^2)
  \to k[t]$ sending $(x,y) \mapsto (t,t^2)$ and $k[t] \to
  k[x,y]/(y-x^2)$ sending $t \mapsto x$ are inverse isomorphisms.

  \medskip\noindent
  (b) We have $A(Y) \simeq k[x,y]/(xy-1)$. Any map of $k$-algebras
  $k[x,y]/(xy-1) \to k[t]$ must send $x$ to a unit, hence to an
  element of $k$, so cannot be injective.

  \medskip\noindent
  (c) Skipped.
