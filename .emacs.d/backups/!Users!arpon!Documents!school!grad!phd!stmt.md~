My time at Harvard has radically shifted my perspective on
mathematics: in place of the haphazard set of computations and
problem-solving techniques I saw before college, I now see a language
that reveals fundamental structures through abstraction, and can
express fascinating stories about these structures. This has in turn
completely transformed my relationship with mathematics: over the past
three years I have chosen to invest a basically absurd portion of my
time in understanding and teaching the subject. In hopes of
understanding far more, my central goal for the future is to sustain
and even amplify this absurdity as a researcher and teacher. Of course
the first step towards this goal will be my graduate studies, and
$school$ would be an ideal setting for taking this step.

I am specifically interested in studying homotopy theory in graduate
school (and beyond), as this is the subject that has most deeply
absorbed me thus far. E.g., I spent this past summer learning about
some fascinating pieces of stable homotopy theory with guidance from
Prof. Jacob Lurie. Namely, after familiarizing myself with spectra and
the stable homotopy category, I worked to understand some homotopy
theory at the heart of the study of manifold cobordism, firstly in
Thom's computation of the unoriented cobordism ring and secondly in
Quillen's computation of the complex cobordism ring. I was then able
to explore the beginnings of chromatic homotopy theory, i.e. the
miraculous connections among stable homotopy theory, formal groups,
and algebraic geometry forged by Quillen's computation. These miracles
inspired me to continue studying these ideas with Prof. Lurie for my
senior thesis, for which I am currently thinking about
algebro-geometric descriptions of the Morava E-theory of (the
classifying spaces of) certain groups; this project fits into a
longer-scale interest of mine which is to contribute to our
understanding of equivariant cohomology theories.

These remarkable interactions among topology, geometry, and algebra
are precisely the reason I am so strongly drawn to homotopy theory. My
principal aim in my first year of graduate school will therefore be to
solidify my understanding of the essential foundations in these
diverse areas, so that I may grasp and research their interactions
from several perspectives. In my early years I plan also to begin
learning about the new roles homotopy theory is playing in fields
outside algebraic topology, e.g. in the logic of homotopy type theory
and in the derived geometry appearing in representation theory and
physics; though I know very little about these areas at the moment,
from afar they seem to be just as inspiringly interconnecting as the
more topological homotopy theory I have focused on thus far. Opening
myself up to the sundry facets and guises of homotopy theory should
give me an excellent chance to understand a great deal of beautiful
mathematics, and in the process find the questions and ideas I am most
riveted by, the ones I will focus on for my dissertation.

I believe I have prepared myself well in my undergraduate years to
achieve the goals I have set out above, and more generally to succeed
as a researching and teaching mathematician. This has involved
sedulous, self-driven work, but it has been unimaginably rewarding,
and I will certainly carry these qualities with me as a graduate
student. My serious interest in mathematics burgeoned only at the very
end of high school, when curiosity about the theory underlying my
computational modeling research led me to learn a bit about
differential equations, and then to Spivak's \emph{Calculus} as I
worked to understand the rigorous foundations of calculus as an
on-and-off side project during my senior year. The resources and
opportunities at Harvard allowed me to tie these loose strands of
curiosity into a knot of utter mathematical zeal at my core. It all
began when I decided to give our infamous freshman course, Math 55, a
go in my first semester and, well, I just kept going. I was
exhilarated learning from and collaborating with brilliant, driven
classmates; my closest friendships came about not over coffee or at
parties, but over mathematics in a basement which we gladly called
home. Before I knew it, I was spending at least thirty hours per week
thinking about math (and probably another thirty hours per week
dreaming about it).

My experience in Math 55 inspired me to spend the following summer
reading about the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras
under the supervision of Prof. Joe Harris. This project in particular
gave me the opportunity to learn and familiarize myself with the
ubiquitous language of general and differential topology, allowing me
to take our sequence of algebraic topology courses in my sophomore
year. It is since then that I have been engrossed in understanding the
beautiful bridges and interactions built and supported by homotopy
theory. In the fall of my junior year, one of my friends and I decided
to engage in an independent reading course on simplicial homotopy
theory and model categories under the supervision of Dr. Emily
Riehl. Seeing homotopy theory as a general framework, illuminating not
only topology but ideas like derived functors in homological algebra
and Andre-Quillen cohomology in commutative algebra, was eye-opening
and compelling. In the same semester I participated in an
undergraduate reading seminar on higher categories, organized by
Dr. Hiro Tanaka; this gave me the chance to give my first
somewhat-formal talk for a specifically mathematical audience, on the
proof and some applications of the Dold-Kan correspondence. And all
this has brought me to my latest exploration of stable homotopy
theory, summarized above.

The actual mathematics I have encountered in these experiences has
been nothing short of spellbinding, but just as key has been the open,
self-guided environments in which I've encountered it. For example,
being able to work through mathematics in free dialogue with Dr. Riehl
at a blackboard in her office was immensely more fun and instructive
than almost any lecture. This has distinctly influenced my philosophy
of learning, convincing me of the virtue of getting to grips with the
core intuition of mathematics; consequently, I am motivated to embody
this virtue whenever I communicate mathematics, especially in
teaching. I have practiced this already as a course assistant for our
Topology I and Algebra II courses, holding office hours and teaching
section, and as an instructor in The Math Circle, a program designed
to remedy the relatively poor quality of math education in most public
schools by introducing students of all ages to the exciting discovery
process of mathematics. For the past three semesters I have had the
opportunity to teach curious, energetic 6--10 year-olds in The Math
Circle, which has been a particularly instructive experience since
these younger students tend to respond \emph{only} to intuitive,
motivated ideas. Guiding them to intuitively discover fundamental
mathematics, e.g. the countability of the rational numbers, has been
and continues to be a unique mixture of mirth and challenge.

My affinity for research-like environments and for teaching has made
me certain that mathematics is my vocation, and in the shorter term
that I will thrive as a graduate student. I believe this would be
especially true at $school$, first and foremost for the opportunity to
learn and collaborate with a constantly outstanding body of
students. $body$ All in all, $school$ would be a practically utopian
place for me to move forward as a mathematician.
