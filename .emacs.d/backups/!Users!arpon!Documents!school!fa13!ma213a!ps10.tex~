\begin{lemma}
  $G/K$ is locally compact hausdorff.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We first prove hausdorffness. Define $\Gamma : G \times K \to G
  \times G$ by $(g,k) \mapsto (g,gk)$. We claim $\im(\Gamma)$ is
  closed in $G \times G$. Indeed, suppose $(g,h) \in G \times G -
  \im(\Gamma)$. Then for all $k \in K$ we must have $h \ne gk$, and
  hence since $G$ is hausdorff there exist disjoint open
  neighbourhoods $U_k \ni h$ and $V_k \ni gk$. Now since $K$ is
  compact, so is $gK$, whence there exists a finite subset $K'
  \subseteq K$ such that $V \coloneqq \bigcup_{k \in K'} V_k \supseteq
  gK$.

Then $U \coloneqq \bigcap_{k \in K'} U_k \ni h$ and $V \supseteq gK
\ni g$ are disjoint opens. So $V \times U$ is an open neighbourhood of
$(g,h)$. Suppose there exist $g' \in G$ and $k \in K$ such that
$(g',g'k) \in V \times U$.
\end{proof}

\subprob{a}

Let $p \in X$. In [Problem Set 4, Problem 1] we proved $\Gamma_p$ is
finite and there exists an open $U \ni p$ such that for each $\gamma
\in \Gamma$ for which $\gamma U \cap U \ne \emptyset$ we in fact have
$\gamma U = U$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma_p$. Since $X$ is locally compact
there is a compact neighbourhood $C_0 \ni p$. Note from the solution
of the cited problem that we can take $U \subseteq C_0$ with no
restriction of generality.

Now since locally compact hausdorff implies regular, we can choose a
an open $U' \ni x$ with $\cl(U') \subseteq U$. Define $U'' \coloneqq
\bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p} \gamma_p^{-1}U'$ and $C \coloneqq
\cl(U'')$. Note that since each $\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p$ is a
homeomorphism we have
\[
\textstyle{C = \cl(\bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p} \gamma_p^{-1}U')
  \subseteq\bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p} \cl(\gamma_p^{-1}U') =
  \bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p} \gamma_p^{-1}\cl(U') \subseteq U}
\]
by construction of $U'$ and $U$. And $U'' \ni x \implies C \ni x$ by
definition of $\Gamma_p$, and $C$ is a closed subset of the compact
set $C_0$, hence compact. Finally if $\gamma \in \Gamma_p$ we have
\[
\textstyle{\gamma U'' = \gamma \bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p}
  \gamma^{-1}U' = \bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p}
  \gamma\gamma_p^{-1}U' = \bigcap_{\gamma_p \in \Gamma_p}
  \gamma_p^{-1}U' = U}
\]
since $\gamma$ permutes $\Gamma_p$, and since $\gamma$ is a
homeomorphism this implies
\[
\gamma C = \gamma \cl(U'') = \cl(\gamma U'') = \cl(U'') = C.
\]
We have shown all the necessary properties of $U$ and $C$. \win
