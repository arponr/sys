the way we think about things is a historical contingency, not
inevitable, and this is  a starting point for looking for alternatives

need to respect ideas of political and economic forebearers, as well
as bring in 21st century techonology

today: a passionate defence of cooperative coeexistence (with
mainstream economics), being a heretic within the system (e.g. martin
luther in religion)

argue for a "social science of the economy", what might it look like?
look at the economy as something integrated in many other systems
(law, culture, etc.) just as biology respects different aspects of an
organism, don't expect one component to explain everything
