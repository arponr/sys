\subsection*{On $\C$}

Let $\{P_k\}_{k \in \N}$ an arbitrary set of principal parts at
$\{z_k\}_{k \in \N}$ with $z_k \to \infty$ (and $z_k \ne 0$ for $k \in
\N$ without loss of generality). In this proof we only needed a
polynomial $q_k$ such that $|P_k(z) - q_k(z)| < 2^{-k}$ on
$\Delta(0,r_k)$ with $0 < r_k < |z_k|$ and $r_k \to \infty$. But this
does not depend on $P_k$ being finite---we can just let $q_k$ be a
sufficiently good approximation to the Laurent series of $P_k$ at $0$,
since $P_k$ only has a pole at $z_k$.

\subsection*{On $U \subsetneq \C$ open}

The proof was by reduction to the case where $\del U$ is compact and
$\{z_k\}_{k \in \N}$ is bounded, via a translation and replacing $z_k$
with $\wtilde z_k \coloneqq 1/z_k$ for $k \in \N$. However, in order
to this we needed to define new principal parts $\wtilde P_k$ at
$\wtilde z_k$ by induction on the coefficients (from lowest degree to
highest). This cannot be done if $P_k$ is not finite.

\subprob{a}

If $F$ is holomorphic on $U$ and has zeros precisely at $\{z_k\}_{k
  \in \N}$, then clearly $f \coloneqq F'/F$ is meromorphic on $U$ with
poles precisely at $z_k$, with residue the order of $F$ at $z_k$, for
$k \in \N$. We can construct such an $f$ using Mittag-Leffler.

\subprob{b}

Let $f$ as in (a). We assume $U$ is simply connected, since otherwise
we don't know how to solve this. Fix $z_0 \in U - \{z_k\}$. For $z \in
U$ choose a path $\gamma_z$ from $z_0$ to $z$ and define
\[
F(z) \coloneqq \exp\left(\int_{\gamma_z} f(z)\,dz\right).
\]
By the residue theorem, for any choice of $\gamma_{z_0}$, enclosing a
region $D \subseteq U$, we have
\[
\int_{\gamma_{z_0}} f(z)\,dz = 2\pi i \sum_{z \in D}
\left.\Res(f(z)\,dz)\right|_z \in 2\pi i\Z.
\]
It follows that $F(z)$ is well-defined, i.e., independent of the
choice of $\gamma_z$. From our work on a previous problem set we know
that $F$ is holomorphic with logarithmic derivative $f$.

Note in the above that we have $\int_{\gamma_z} f(z)\,dz = -\infty$ if
and only if $z \in \{z_k\}$; that is, this holds precisely in the
limits $z \to z_k$, since these are precisely the poles of $f$. And
hence we have $F(z) = 0$ if and only if $z \in \{z_k\}$.

\prob{3}

Write $p_k(z) \eqqcolon \sum_{n=0}^{d_k} a_{k,n}z^n$ for $k \in
\N$. By Weierstrass we can construct a holomorphic function $f_1$ on
$\C$ with zeros precisely at $z_k$ for $k \in \N$, with order $d_k +
1$. Let $L_{1,k}(z) \coloneqq \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_{k,n}
(z-z_k)^{n+d_k+1}$ be the Laurent expansion of $f_1$ at $z_k$ for $k
\in \N$---note $b_{k,0} \ne 0$. Then for $k \in \N$ define inductively
\[
c_{k,0} \coloneqq \frac{a_{k,0}}{b_{k,0}} \quad\text{and}\quad c_{k,n}
\coloneqq \frac{a_{k,n} - \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} b_{k,n-m} c_{k,m}}{b_{k,0}}
\quad \text{for } 1 \le n \le d_k,
\]
and let $L_{2,k}(z) \coloneqq \sum_{n=0}^{d_k} c_{k,n}
(z-z_k)^{n-d_k-1}$. Then by construction we will have
\[
L_{1,k}(z)L_{2,k}(z) = p_k(z-z_k) + O(z_k^{d_k+1}) \quad\text{for } k
\in \N.
\]
Thus if we construct by Mittag-Leffler a meromorphic function $f_2$ on
$\C$ with poles precisely at $z_k$, with principal part $L_{2,k}(z)$,
for $k \in \N$, then $f \coloneqq f_1f_2$ has the desired Taylor
approximations.

\prob{4}

We have a change of variables
\[
\int_0^\infty e^{it}t^{z-1}\,dt = i^z \int_0^\infty
e^{it}(-it^{z-1})(-i)\,dt = e^{\pi iz/2} \lim_{R \to \infty}
\int_0^{-Ri} e^{-t}t^{z-1}\,dt.
\]
Now for $0 < \Rez < 1$, we have
\[
\left|\int_0^R e^{-t-Ri}(Ri+t)^{z-1}\,dt\right| \le \int_0^R
e^{-t}R^{\Rez - 1}\,dt \le R^{\Rez - 1}(1 - e^{-R}),
\]
\[
\left|\int_0^R e^{-R-ti}(R+it)^{z-1}\,dt\right| \le \int_0^R
e^{-R}R^{\Rez - 1}\,dt \le e^{-R}R^{\Rez},
\]
both of which tend to $0$ as $R \to \infty$. Since $e^{-t}t^{z-1}$ is
holomorphic on $\{\Rez \ge 0\}$, it follows that
\[
\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_0^{-Ri} e^{-t}t^{z-1}\,dt = \int_0^\infty
e^{-t}t^{z-1}\,dt = \Gamma(z) \implies \int_0^\infty e^{it}t^{z-1}\,dt
= i^z\,\Gamma(z) = e^{i \pi z/2}\,\Gamma(z).
\]
Note that this shows in particular that the integral
converges. However the integral does \textit{not} converge absolutely,
since we have $|e^{it}t^{z-1}| = t^{\Re z - 1}$ for $t \in \R$, and if
$0 < \Re z < 1$ then $\int_0^\infty t^{\Re z - 1}\,dt$ clearly does
not converge.
