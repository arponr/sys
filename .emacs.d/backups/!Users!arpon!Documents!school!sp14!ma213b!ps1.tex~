Let $\Delta \subset \C$ denote the open unit disk and $\Delta^*
\coloneqq \Delta - \{0\}$. Note that the only zero of $f$ on $\Delta$
is at $0$. Let $p : \C^* \to \C^*$ be the covering $z \mapsto
z^2$. Consider the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \ & \C^* \dar{p} \\ \Delta^* \rar{f} \ar[dashed]{ur}{h} & \C^*
\end{tikzcd}
\]
and observe that finding a square root $h$ of $f$ on $\Delta^*$ is
indeed equivalent to finding a lift in the diagram. From covering
space theory we know such a lift exists (and is automatically
holomorphic) if and only if
\[
\im(f_*: \pi_1(\Delta^*) \to \pi_1(\C^*)) \subseteq \im(p_* :
\pi_1(\C^*) \to \pi_1(\C^*)).
\]
Now, $\pi_1(\Delta^*) \simeq \pi_1(\C^*) \simeq \Z$ and $\im(p_*) =
2\Z \subset \Z$. Then by the argument principle, to check the above
lifting condition it suffices that any loop in $\Delta^*$ encloses in
$\C$ an even number of zeros of $f$. But $f$ has just one zero, at $0$,
with order $2$ so this is indeed satisfied.

The universal cover of $B \coloneqq S^1 \vee S^1$ is the Cayley graph
of $\pi_1(B) \simeq F_2$, the free group on two generators. Thus there
is a vertex for each word in $F_2$, each with degree four, forming a
sort of fractal of things which look like ``$+$''.

The Cayley graph of $S_3 \simeq \langle r, f \mid r^3 = f^2 = \id, rf
= fr^{-1} \rangle$, pictured below, gives the required covering space
$B'$.

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[nd] (om) at (0,2) [label=left:$f$] {};
    \node[nd] (im) at (0,.67) [label=left:$\id$] {};
    \node[nd] (ir) at (0.57,-0.33) [label=above:$r$] {};
    \node[nd] (il) at (-0.57,-0.33) [label=above:$r^2$] {};
    \node[nd] (or) at (1.73,-1) [label=right:$rf$] {};
    \node[nd] (ol) at (-1.73,-1) [label=left:$r^2f$] {};

    \draw[redarr] (om) to (ol);
    \draw[redarr] (ol) to (or);
    \draw[redarr] (or) to (om);
    \draw[redarr] (im) to (ir);
    \draw[redarr] (ir) to (il);
    \draw[redarr] (il) to (im);

    \draw[bluarr] (im) to [bend left = 15] (om);
    \draw[bluarr] (om) to [bend left = 15] (im);
    \draw[bluarr] (il) to [bend left = 15] (ol);
    \draw[bluarr] (ol) to [bend left = 15] (il);
    \draw[bluarr] (ir) to [bend left = 15] (or);
    \draw[bluarr] (or) to [bend left = 15] (ir);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

Note $S^3$ acts on the covering $B'$ pictured above simply via
left-multiplication. Since $A_3 \subset S_3$ is generated by $r$ we
just quotient $B'$ by the action of $r$ to obtain the covering $B'$
pictured below. Since $A_3$ is normal in $S^3$ we have $\Gal(B''/B)
\simeq S^3/A^3 \simeq \Z/2$.

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[nd] (l) at (-0.75,0) [label=above:$\id$] {};
    \node[nd] (r) at (0.75,0) [label=above:$f$] {};

    \draw[bluarr] (l) to [bend left = 20] (r);
    \draw[bluarr] (r) to [bend left = 20] (l);
    \draw[redarr] (l) to [out=150,in=210,looseness=20] (l);
    \draw[redarr] (r) to [out=330,in=30,looseness=20] (r);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
