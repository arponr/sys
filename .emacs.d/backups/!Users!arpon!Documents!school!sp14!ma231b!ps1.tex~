\prob{1}

Let $\pi \c E \to B$ be a real vector bundle with $B$ paracompact. Let
$\{U_i\}$ be a cover of $B$ consisting of open sets over which $\pi$
is trivial. Since $B$ is paracompact we can without loss of generality
take the cover to be locally finite, and we can choose a partition of
unity $\{\phi_i\}$ subordinate to the cover. Let
\[
q_i \c \pi^{-1}(U_i) \simeq U_i \times \R^{n_i} \to \R
\]
be the standard Euclidean metric on the trivial bundle $\pi \c
\pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i$. Then we can define
\[
\textstyle{q \c E \to \R, \quad e \mapsto \sum \phi_i(\pi(e)) \cdot
  q_i(e)}.
\]
Note $q$ is well-defined by local finiteness, and is continuous since
$q_i,\phi_i,\pi$ and addition and multiplication are. Since each $q_i$
is positive-definite quadratic on fibres, so is $q$.

\prob{2}

\subprob{a}

If $n$ is odd we can identify $\R^{n+1} \simeq \C^m$, where $m \ce
(n+1)/2$. Then $v \c S^n \to \C^m$ defined by $x \mapsto ix$ clearly
gives a nowhere zero tangent vector field on $S^n$.

\subprob{b}

Assume we have a nowhere zero vector field $v \c S^n \to
\R^{n+1}$. Then
\[
S^n \times [0,1] \to S^n, \quad (x,t) \mapsto \cos(\pi t)x + \sin(\pi
t)v(x)/|v(x)|
\]
evidently defines a homotopy from $\id_{S^n}$ to $-\id_{S^n}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{3}

To show $-\id_{S^n}$ is homotopic to $r$ it suffices to show any
double reflection
\[
(x_1,\ldots,x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n) \mapsto
(x_1,\ldots,-x_i,-x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)
\]
is homotopic to $\id_{S^n}$. But this is evident from the homotopy
\[
(x_i,x_{i+1}) \mapsto (\cos(\pi t)x_i + \sin(\pi t)x_{i+1},\cos(\pi
t)x_{i+1} - \sin(\pi t)x_i).
\]
Therefore $\deg(-\id_{S^n}) = \deg(r) = -1$.

If $TS^n \to S^n$ were trivial, it would admit a nowhere zero section,
that is, a nowhere zero vector field. By Problem 2, then we would have
$-\id_{S^n} \sim \id_{S^n} \implies \deg(-\id_{S^n}) = 1$,
contradiction.
