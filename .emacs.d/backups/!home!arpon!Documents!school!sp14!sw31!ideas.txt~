two main directions in the evolution of economics:
1. a shift from theory-building to problem-solving
2. a shift in what counts as evidence

of course these two shifts are not unrelated

in a correct theory of economics one needs both theory-building and
problem-solving. until there is a grand unified descriptive theory -
which unger's program is certainly not an example of - if one ever
even exists, one needs a way to evaluate and predict how correct one's
theory is. i mean certainly one can experiment, but one needs some
hypotheses, something to inform what experiments to perform, and this
is what theory should be. to understand this rigorously, one
necesarily needs some form of the marginalist stuff.
