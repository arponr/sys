\prob{1}

Choose any coordinate $z_0 \c (U,p) \simeq (\Delta,0)$ with $U$ small
enough so that we can write $\omega|_U = f\,dz_0$, where $f \c U \to
\C$ is holomorphic. Then we know we can write $f = z_1^n$ where $z_1
\c (V,p) \simeq (\Delta,0)$ is another coordinate. We must have $dz_0
= \alpha\,dz_1$ for some $\alpha \in \C^*$. So now $\omega|_U = \alpha
z_1^n \, dz_1$. Finally choose $\beta \in \C^*$ so that $\beta^{n+1} =
\alpha$ and define $z \ce z_1/\beta$. Then $\omega|_U = z^n\,dz$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{2}

Let $V \c \C \to \C$ be smooth and write $V = f + ig$ where $f,g \c \C
\to \R$ are smooth. Then writing $z = x + iy$ we have
\[
2 \d{V}{z} = \l(\d{f}{x} + \d{g}{y}\r) + i\l(\d{g}{x} - \d{f}{y}\r),
\quad
2 \d{V}{\oline z} = \l(\d{f}{x} - \d{g}{y}\r) + i\l(\d{g}{x} +
\d{f}{y}\r).
\]
Thus we can write
\begin{align*}
  \nabla V &= \begin{pmatrix} \Re\l(\d{V}{z} + \d{V}{\oline z}\r) &
    \Im\l(\d{V}{z} + \d{V}{\oline z}\r) \\ \Im\l(\d{V}{z} -
  \d{V}{\oline z}\r) & \Re\l(\d{V}{z} -
  \d{V}{\oline z}\r)\end{pmatrix}, \\
  \nabla \cdot V &= 2 \Re\l(\d{V}{z}\r), \\
  \nabla \times V &= 2 \Im\l(\d{V}{z}\r).
\end{align*}
Now, let $U \subset \C$ be a compact region with smooth boundary. By
Stokes' theorem we have
\[
d(V\,d\oline z) = \d{V}{z}\, dz \wedge d\oline z \implies \int_{\del
  U} V\,d\oline z = \int_U \d{V}{z}\, dz \wedge d\oline z.
\]
We have $dz \wedge d\oline z = -2i\,dx \wedge dy$, so taking the real
and imaginary parts of this equation we get the identities
\begin{align*}
  \int_{\del U} V \cdot T\,ds &= \int_{\del U} f\,dx + g\,dy = \int_U
  \nabla \times V\, dA, \\
  \int_{\del U} V \cdot n\,ds &= \int_{\del U} f\,dy - g\,dx = \int_U
  \nabla \cdot V\, dA.
\end{align*}

\prob{3}

\subprob{i}

We know near $p$ there is a holomorphic function $f$ such that $\omega
= df = \del f$. Let $u \ce f + \oline f$, so clearly $u$ is harmonic
and real. Then $\del \oline f = \oline \del f = 0$ so $\del u = \del f
= \omega$.

\subprob{ii}

Consider $X \ce \C/\Lambda$ a torus and $\omega \ce dz \in
\Omega(X)$. There are no nonconstant harmonic functions on $X$ since
$X$ is compact, so we can't write $\omega = \del u$ on $X$ since
$\omega \ne 0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{4}

Let $p \in X$. Choose coordinates $z \c (U,p) \simeq (\Delta,0)$ and
$\zeta \c (V,f(p)) \simeq (\Delta,0)$ such that $z \circ f = \zeta^n$
where $n = \operatorname{mult}(f,p)$. If locally at $f(p)$ we have
$\omega = \sum a_jz^j\,dz$ then we see that locally near $p$ we have
\[
\textstyle{f^*(\omega) = \sum a_j (z \circ f)^j d(z \circ f) = \sum
  n a_j \zeta^{nj+n-1}\,d\zeta},
\]
implying $\Res(p,f^*(\omega)) = n \Res(f(p),\omega)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{5}

We claim there exists a holomorphic map $f \c X \to
\C/\Lambda$. Indeed, choose any $p \in X$. For $x \in X$, choose any
path $\gamma$ from $p$ to $x$ and define
\[
f(x) \ce \int_\gamma \omega.
\]
This is independent of the choice $\gamma$ by definition of $\Lambda$,
and hence evidently holomorphic. Note that if $\omega \ne 0$, in
particular if $\Lambda \ne 0$, then certainly $f$ is nonconstant.

\subprob{i}

Suppose $\Lambda \simeq \Z$. By the above there is a nonconstant
holomorphic map $X \to \C/\Lambda$. But $\C/\Lambda$ is homeomorphic
to an infinite cylinder, in particular is not compact. Since $X$ is
compact this is a contradiction.

\subprob{ii}

This is immediate from the above since if $\Lambda$ is a lattice then
$\C/\Lambda$ is a Riemann surface of genus one.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{6}

\subprob{i}

Let $\omega \in \Omega(X)$. Let $X^* \subseteq X$ and $Y^* \subseteq
Y$ be as usual so that $f \c X^* \to Y^*$ is a covering. Let $y \in
Y^*$ and $x \in f^{-1}(y)$. Then there are open neighbourhoods $U \ni
x$ and $V \ni y$ such that $f \c U \to V$ is an isomorphism with
inverse $g_x \c V \to U$. In particular $D^*g_x \c T^{(1)}U \to
T^{(1)}V$ is an isomorphism. We define $f_*(\omega)_y \ce \sum_{f(x) =
  y} D^*g_x(\omega_x)$. Note that on $V \subset Y^*$ we can order the
inverses $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ and write
\begin{equation}
  \label{pushfwd} \tag{$*$}
  \textstyle{f_*(\omega) = \sum_{j=1}^n D^*g_j \circ \omega \circ g_j},
\end{equation}
and hence $f_*(\omega)$ is holomorphic on $Y^*$.

Now suppose $y \in Y - Y^*$. Choose a coordinate $z \c (V,y) \simeq
(\Delta,0)$ such that $V - \{y\} \subseteq Y^*$. From the above we
have $f_*(\omega)|_{V - \{y\}} = f_*(\omega)(z)\,dz$ with
$f_*(\omega)(z)$ holomorphic. Therefore to extend $f_*(\omega)$ to $y$
it suffices to check that $f_*(\omega)(z)$ is bounded on $V$. But this
is evident from the fact that $\omega$ is defined holomorphically at
each $x \in f^{-1}(y)$.

Finally consider the case $\omega = f^*(\eta)$ for some $\eta \in
\Omega(Y)$. By definition then $\omega = D^*f \circ \eta \circ f$, so
on $Y^*$, (\ref{pushfwd}) becomes
\[
f_*(\omega) = \sum_{j=1}^n D^*g_j \circ D^*f \circ \eta \circ f \circ
g_j = \sum_{j=1}^n \eta = n \cdot \eta,
\]
since $f \circ g_j = \id$ by definition. Then the unique extension to
$Y$ must give $f_*(\omega) = \deg(f) \cdot \eta$.

\subprob{ii}

Let $z \in \C$, not a critical value of $f$. Consider $\omega \ce
dw/(f(w)-z) \in \Omega(\P^1)$. Since $\deg(f) \ge 2$ and $dw$ has a
pole of order $2$ at $\infty$, $\omega$ has poles precisely at $w \in
\C$ such that $f(w) = z$. And since $z$ is not a critical value, these
are simple poles with residue $1/f'(w)$. Since $\P^1$ is compact it
follows from the residue theorem that
\[
\textstyle{\sum_{f(w) = z} 1/f'(w) = \sum_p \Res(p,\omega) = 0.}
\]

\prob{7}

Analogous to the analysis for hyperelliptic curves in lecture, we
consider the orders of $x$, $y$, and $dx$ over the branch locus $B =
\{\pm 1, \pm i\}$ and over $\infty$. Note that by Riemann-Hurwitz,
since each critical point has multiplicity $4$, there is no branching
over $\infty$. We arrive at the following orders:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  & $x$ & $dx$ & $y$ \\
  \hline
  $B$ & $\ge 0$ & $3$ & $1$ \\
  \hline
  $\infty$ & $-1$ & $-2$ & $-1$ \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
It follows that
\[
\frac{dx}{y^2}, \quad \frac{dx}{y^3}, \quad \frac{x\,dx}{y^3}
\]
are all in $\Omega(X)$. These are evidently linearly independent, and
hence a basis since we know $\dim(\Omega(X)) = 3$.
