\prob{1}

Let $\Vec^k(X)$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of vector
bundles of rank $k$ on a space $X$. Since $A$ and $B$ are paracompact
we have
\[
\Vec^k(A) \simeq [A, \Gr_k] \quad\text{and}\quad
\Vec^k(B) \simeq [B, \Gr_k],
\]
with the isomorphisms given by pullback $h \mapsto
h^*\gamma^k$. Suppose $\xi \simeq h^*\gamma^k$. Then $f^*\xi \simeq
(fh)^*\gamma^k$ and $g^*\xi \simeq (gh)^*\gamma^k$. But $f \sim g
\implies fh \sim gh$, whence we must have $f^*\xi \simeq g^*\xi$.

\prob{2}

Let $V \in \Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ and fix any orthonormal basis
$(v_1,\ldots,v_k) \in V_k(\R^{n+k})$ of $V$. Let $U \subset
\Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ be the fundamental open neighbourhood of $V$
discussed in lecture, so that $U \simeq \hom(V, V^\perp)$. Then $W \in
U$ corresponding to $T \in \hom(V,V^\perp)$ has a basis $(v_i +
T(v_i))$. By applying Gram-Schmidt to this canonical choice of basis
we get a continuous section $s \c U \to q^{-1}(U)$.

Now, this gives us a continuous map
\[
U \times O(k) \to q^{-1}(U), \quad W \times A \mapsto A \cdot s(W).
\]
Conversely if we have $b \in q^{-1}(W)$ then (identifying bases with
matrices in the obvious way), $A \ce bs(W)^{1}$ gives us the
orthogonal change of basis matrix from $s(W)$ to $b$. This evidently
gives a continuous inverse
\[
q^{-1}(U) \to U \times O(k), \quad b \mapsto (q(b), bs(W)^{-1}).
\]
Hence $q^{-1}(U) \simeq U \times O(k)$. Since $V$ was arbitrary this
implies $q$ is a fibre bundle with fibre $O(k)$.

\prob{3}

\newcommand{\nm}{\mathrm{nm}}

Let $V_1,V_2 \in \Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ be two distinct $k$-planes. Choose
$v \in V_1 - V_2$. For $W \in \Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ let $\pr_W \c \R^{n+k}
\to \R^{n+k}/W \simeq \R^n$ be the linear projection. Let $\nm \c \R^n
\to \R$ be the $\ell_2$-norm map $x \mapsto \|x\|_2$. Consider the map
\[
f \c \Gr_k(\R^{n+k}) \to \R, \quad W \mapsto (\nm \circ \pr_W)(v).
\]
Clearly $f$ distinguishes between $V_1$ and $V_2$, as $f(V_1) = 0$ and
$f(V_2) \ne 0$. So we just need to check $f$ is continuous; of course
$\nm$ is continuous so it suffices to check $W \mapsto \pr_W(v)$ is
continuous. But writing $W$ in terms of orthonormal frames $W =
(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$ we have
\[
\textstyle{\pr_W(v) = v - \sum_{i=1}^k \langle v, w_i \rangle w_i}.
\]
This clearly defines a continuous map from the Stiefel manifold, and
hence from $\Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ which by definition has the quotient
topology.

\prob{4}

Let $e_1 \in \R^1 \oplus \R^{n+k}$ denote the canonical generator of
$\R^1$. Then in coordinates, that is, on the level of Stiefel
manifolds, that map $f$ is given by $(v_1,\ldots,v_k) \mapsto
(e_1,,v_1,\ldots,v_k)$. This has obvious continuous inverse given by
projection, so by the universal property of the quotient we see that
$f$ defines an embedding $\Gr_k(\R^{n+k}) \to
\Gr_{k+1}(\R^{n+k+1})$. To define the bundle map
\[
\epsilon^1 \oplus \gamma^k(\R^{n+k}) \to \gamma^{k+1}(\R^{n+k+1})
\]
over $f$, recall that by definition
\[
\epsilon^1 \oplus \gamma^k(\R^{n+k}) \simeq (\epsilon^1 \times
\gamma^k(\R^{n+k})) \times_{\Gr_k(\R^{n+k}) \times \Gr_k(\R^{n+k})}
\Gr_k(\R^{n+k})
\]
and $\gamma^{k+1}(\R^{n+k+1}) \subset \Gr_{k+1}(\R^{n+k+1}) \times
\R^{n+k+1}$. Then the bundle map to the first factor of the target is
just given by projection to $\Gr_k(\R^{n+k})$ followed by $f$, so that
the map indeed covers $f$. And to the second factor we project to
$\epsilon^1 \times \gamma^k(\R^{n+k})$ and then apply the map
\[
((V,t),(V,v)) \mapsto (\R^1 \oplus V, te_1 + v).
\]
