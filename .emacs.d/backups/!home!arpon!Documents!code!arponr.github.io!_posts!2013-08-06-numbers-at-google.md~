      <h3>reflection on a day during my internship at google</h3>

    <article class="wrap text">
      <p>This is a post about some numbers that I saw at work one
        day during my internship at Google. I present them to you
        without further ado.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>21:</strong> I got to run a job with 21
          terabytes of input. <em>Tera</em>. And that's
          compressed.</li>
        <li><strong>10000000000:</strong> 21 TB means I got to
          compute statistics on data sets of size greater than 10
          billion. <em>Billion</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>3:</strong> It took fewer than 3 hours to run
          that job. I love MapReduce and resources.</li>
        <li><strong>23:</strong> Later on, after realising I had
          made some stupid mistakes, I needed to run that job again
          (and because it felt so damn cool the first time, and I
          could, so why not). Anyway it turns out the data was on
          some machines on the East Coast, and the job was running
          on machines on the West Coast. That's efficiency. Well so
          I (and, by &quot;I&quot;, I mean someone else on my team
          who actually knew what he was doing) managed to get the
          job running next door to the data. And for ten minutes or
          so, that 21 TB was being sent to the job at more than 23
          gigbatyes per second. <em>Giga</em>. Holy bandwidth,
          batman.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So it turns out working at Google indeed has perks. Those
        numbers are all due to some really smart people that work
        (or have worked) here. That's nice to think about. It's even
        nicer to stop thinking about that, look at those numbers,
        and just feel dope as hell, if only for a moment.</p>
      <p>Perhaps two moments, though. A new number arrived the
        following day.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30:</strong> After tweaking some things, the job
          ran in less than 30 minutes. That's some astounding
          stuff.</li>
      </ul>
