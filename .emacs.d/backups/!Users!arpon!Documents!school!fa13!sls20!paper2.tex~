\section{The big idea}

Many ``macroscopic'' objects we consider and study---e.g., society,
organisms, computers, and matter---are composed of a large number of
``microscopic'' units---e.g., people, organs, bits, and particles.
Emergence is the idea that simple structure at the microscopic level
can give rise to comparatively complex structure at the macroscopic
level. This notion arose already in our discussion of the brain and
mind. At the foundation of cognitive neuroscience and psychology is
the theory that the elaborate human conscious and mental experience
\textit{emerges} from only the physical operation of the nervous
system, which further relies only on the firing or non-firing of
neurons.

The first section further explored emergence and emergent
properties. In one activity, we were assigned random numbers such that
each of us could see the others' numbers but not our own. We were then
given the task to pair up, with the goal of pairing with the highest
numbered individual we could. From this simple goal guiding individual
interactions emerged an interesting macroscopic outcome: each person
paired with the indivdidual with the number nearest to theirs. The
activity simulated an emergent property of people's mating behaviour
in society: on average, people who mate with one other are of similar
attractiveness. The following activity made this observation even more
interesting. We were again assigned numbers in the same manner, but
now given the goal to pair up with the individual with the number we
believed would be nearest to our own. With this guide for interaction,
pairing became essentially random, starkly contrasting the first
activity. This demonstrates that macroscopic emergent structure can
change dramatically when the microscopic structure is altered
slightly, and moreover does not depend at all in a straightforward
manner on the microscopic structure.

The final activity revealed an emergent property which is perhaps of
even more social significance. We were split into two groups and
alternatingly members of each group down, but only allowed to sit next
to a member of the same group. Of course the two groups ended up
seated in a completely segregated manner. While the result in this toy
model is obvious and predictable, it provides a startlingly simple
explanation of segregation in society. Even a slight, seemingly
harmless preference for interacting with similar people at the
individual level may give rise to a segregated society, an emergent
structure which many would deem harmful. This in particular
exemplifies the power of emergence in translating individual
psychological tendencies to social psychological tendencies.

\section{The article}

In \textit{Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology}, Braitenburg
(1986) discusses emergence in the context of consciousness and
cognition, as mentioned earlier. Several thought experiments are
suggested; in each, a very simply functioning machine, or
\textit{vehicle}, is described, and its hypothetical behaviour is then
analysed.

The simplest vehicle can move in precisely one direction and has
precisely one sensor (p. 3). The sensor causes the vehicle to
accelerate in warmer regions. Assuming that friction will cause random
perturbations in the vehicles movement, Braitenburg concludes that
because of its continuous and variable motion, the vehicle will seem
\textit{alive}---a restless organism which does not like high
temperature, but which is not intelligent enough to remain in colder
regions (p. 5). The most complex vehicle has four sensors connected in
various manners to two motors on opposite sides of the vehicle
(p. 12). These connections are such that the vehicle exhibits the
following behaviour.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vehicle turns away from high temperatures.
\item The vehicle accelerates towards light sources.
\item The vehicle settles in regions with high oxygen content, but may
  then drift away.
\item The vehicle settles in regions with large quanitites of organic
  matter, in a relatively permanent fashion.
\end{enumerate}
Note that we can characterise (1) as \textit{dislike}, (2) as
\textit{hatred} or \textit{aggression}, (3) as \textit{exploratory
  affinity}, and (4) as \textit{love}. Braitenburg describes this
behaviour as the vehicle's ``system of \textit{values}'' (p. 12).

Braitenburg's vehicles can help us think about the human mind's
emergence from the physical structure of the nervous system. Though
the described machines consist only of a few basic components, we see
that just these components are able to give rise to lifelike and even
quite complex behaviour in the world. This lends plausability to the
idea that discrete signals between the \textit{billions} of neurons in
the human body might produce such complex behaviour as we observe and
experience. These thought experiments also suggest the intriguing idea
that sophisticated enough machines might approximate the behaviour of
animals and humans. This furthermore brings up the question of whether
we would consider these machines, or ``artificial intelligences'', to
have minds, and if so, whether our notions of scientific psychology
could also apply there.

\section{Discussion}

The activities in section and Braitenburg's thought experiments give
us perfectly intuitive examples of emergent properties. In each case
it is not difficult to see that, although a thought-provoking
transition is made from microscopic structure to macroscopic
structure, it is a logical one. I.e., one can imagine being able to
construct, given enough time, the macroscopic structure simply by
analysing the microscopic structure carefully enough. Indeed this is
precisely what Braitenberg does in \textit{Vehicles}. This notion of
emergence has come to be known as \textit{weak emergence}, perhaps
coined by Bedau (1997). This is simply the notion that microscopic
structure can induce macroscopic structure in a system composed of
many interacting units. Bedau phrases this by saying that an emergent
property at the macroscopic scale can be discovered simply by
simulating the system's microscopic structure and interactions.

There is also a notion of emergence known as \textit{strong
  emergence}, which as one might astutely guess, is stronger than the
intuitive picture discussed above. Strong emergence claims that
properties can emerge at the macroscopic scale which cannot be reduced
to consequences of the microscopic structure. This seems like a sort
of fuzzy philosophical claim, but in fact it has deep roots in
physics! In ``More is different'', Anderson argues against the sort of
``reductionist'' ideas in science, e.g., that psychology is just
applied biology, which is just applied chemistry, which is just
applied physics, and that one can always reconstruct higher level
phenomena from more foundational theories. He supplies as a
counterexample the idea of \textit{spontaneous symmetry breaking},
which roughly implies that the macroscopic system can lack certain
symmetries that the microscopic structure enjoys, which is not
something one can obtain (via simulation, say) from just microscopic
information.

What might this distinction between weak and strong emergence have to
do with psychology? Certainly psychology studies a type of weak
emergence: how physical neuronal activity gives rise to human
cognition and mental processes. Something interesting to consider is
whether this is in fact a \textit{strong} emergence. That is, are
there psychological phenomena which cannot just be deduced or
simulated from an understanding of the biology of the nervous system?
An answer in either direction would have fascinating implications in
particular about the relationship between psychology and neuroscience.
