\prob{1}

Let $\til G \ce \prod_{i \in I} G_i$. For each finite $J \subseteq I$
define $\til G_J \ce \prod_{j \in J} G_j$ and $G_J \ce \lim_{j \in J}
G_j \subseteq \til G_J$; let $\til p_J \c \til G \to \til G_J$ be the
canonical projection and define $X_J \ce {\til p_J}^{-1}(G_J)$. Then
$G = \bigcap_J X_J \subseteq \til G$, so for any $g_i \in G_i$ we have
$p_i^{-1}(g_i) = \bigcap_J X_J \cap p_i^{-1}(g_i)$. Since $\til G$ is
compact (by Tychonoff) and $X_{J_1} \cap \cdots \cap X_{J_n} = X_{J_1
  \cup \cdots \cup J_n}$, to prove surjectivity of $p_i$ it suffices
to show each $X_J \cap p_i^{-1}(g_i)$ is nonempty. To produce an
element, choose some $k \in I$ such that $k \ge i$ and $k \ge j$ for
all $j \in J$. By surjectivity of $\pi^k_i \c G_k \to G_i$ we can
choose $g_k \in (\pi^k_i)^{-1}(g_i)$. If we define $g_j \ce
\pi^k_j(g_k)$ for $j \in J$ and choose arbitrary $g_j \in G_j$ for $j
\in I - (J \cup \{i,k\})$ it is clear that $(g_j) \in X_J \cap
p_i^{-1}(g_i)$.

\prob{2}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{surj-image-sylow}
  Let $\phi \c G \to G'$ be an epimorphism of groups. Let $H$ be a
  Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ for some prime $p$. Then $H' \ce \phi(H)$
  is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Without loss of generality we may assume $\phi$ is the projection $G
  \to G/N$ for some normal subgroup $N \subseteq G$, so that $H' =
  HN/N$. Then $H' \iso H/(H \cap N)$ so $H'$ is a $p$-group, and
  \[
  p \nmid [G : H] \implies p \nmid [G : HN] = [G/N : HN/N],
  \]
  implying $H'$ is Sylow.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{pro-sylow-factors}
  Let $G$ be a profinite group and $H \subseteq G$ a Sylow pro-$p$
  subgroup for some prime $p$. Then for every open normal subgroup $N
  \subseteq G$, $HN/N$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G/N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We have already shown in lecture that each $H_N \ce HN/N$ is
  necessarily a $p$-group. So the set $X_N$ of Sylow $p$-subgroups of
  $G/N$ containing $H_N$ is nonempty (and finite). By
  Lm. \ref{surj-image-sylow} the $X_N$ form a projective system, so we
  may form $\lim X_N$ and it must be nonempty, containing some element
  $(H'_N)$. By construction we may form $H' \ce \lim H'_N$, a pro-$p$
  subgroup which contains $H$ since $H'_N \supseteq H_N$ for each
  $N$. Since $H$ is Sylow this implies $H = H'$ and hence $H_N = H'_N$
  for each $N$, proving the claim.
\end{proof}

Now let $H, H'$ be two Sylow pro-$p$ subgroups of a profinite group
$G$. By Lm. \ref{pro-sylow-factors}, for each open normal subgroup $N
\susbeteq G$ the quotients $HN/N$ and $H'N/N$ are Sylow $p$-subgroups
of $G/N$, and hence must be conjugate. Thus we may define nonempty
(and finite) sets $X_N \ce \{g \in G/N : g(HN/N)g^{-1} = H'N/N\}$. It
is evident that the $X_N$ form a projective system, and hence we may
form $\lim X_N$ and it must be nonempty, containing some $(g_N)$ which
by construction is an element $g \in G \iso \lim G/N$. Now we have
$gHg^{-1} = H'$ since this is true by construction after quotienting
by any open normal $N$.

\prob{3}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{units-lim-commute}
  The units functor $R \mapsto R^\times$, from the category of
  topological rings to the category of topological groups, preserves
  limits.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This is immediate from the fact that the units functor is
  corepresentable: $R^\times \iso \hom(\Z[t,t^{-1}],R)$.
\end{proof}

For $n \in \N$ let $\mu_n$ denote a primitive $n$-th root of
unity. Note that there is a morphism $\Q(\mu_m) \to \Q(\mu_n)$ if and
only if $m \mid n$, and the induced morphism
\[
(\Z/n)^\times \iso \Gal(\Q(\mu_n)/\Q) \to \Gal(\Q(\mu_m)/\Q) \iso
(\Z/m)^\times
\]
is then the canonical one, induced by reduction $\Z/n \to \Z/m$. Thus,
since $\Q(\mu) \iso \colim \Q(\mu_n)$ we have
\[
\Gal(\Q(\mu)/\Q) \iso \lim \Gal(\Q(\mu_n)/\Q) \iso \lim
{(\Z/n)^\times} \iso (\lim \Z/n)^\times \iso \hat \Z^\times,
\]
where we have applied Lm. \ref{units-lim-commute} for the second to
last isomorphism. And similarly, since $\Q(\mu_{p^\infty}) \iso \colim
\Q(\mu_{p^n})$ we have
\[
\Gal(\Q(\mu_{p^\infty})/\Q) \iso \lim \Gal(\Q(\mu_{p^n})/\Q) \iso \lim
{(\Z/p^n)^\times} \iso (\lim \Z/p^n)^\times \iso \Z_p^\times.
\]

\prob{4}

Fix $n \in \N$. We have proved in lecture that the open subgroups of
index $n$ in $\Gal(\o\Q/\Q)$ are in bijection with degree $n$
intermediate extensions of $\Q \inj \o\Q$, i.e. degree $n$ extensions
of $\Q$. Just taking $n=2$, we know there are infinitely many
quadratic extensions of $\Q$, implying there are infinitely many
subgroups of $\Gal(\o\Q/\Q)$ of index $2$. So $\Gal(\o\Q/\Q)$ cannot
be finitely generated by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{fg-subgroup-index}
  Let $G$ be a finitely generated group. Fix $n \in \N$. There are
  only finitely many subgroups of $G$ of index $n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $S$ denote the set of subgroups of $G$ of index $n$. For each $H
  \in S$ we have an action $\alpha_H \c G \to \Aut(G/H)$ by
  right-multiplication on right-cosets. Choosing bijections $G/H \iso
  \{1,\ldots,n\}$ for each $H \in S$, we get a map $\alpha \c S \to
  \Hom(G,\Sigma_n)$ where $\Sigma_n \ce \Aut(\{1,\ldots,n\})$ is the
  symmetric group. Since each $H \in S$ can be recovered as the
  stabiliser of the coset $H \in G/H$ under the action $\alpha_H$, we
  find that $\alpha$ is injective. Finally, since $G$ is finitely
  generated and $\Sigma_n$ is finite, $\Hom(G,\Sigma_n)$ is finite,
  implying $S$ is finite.
\end{proof}

\prob{5}

\subprob{a}

Let $H \subseteq G$ be any subgroup. For any $g \in G$,
right-multiplication by $g$ is a homeomorphism $G \to G$, so $H$ is
open (resp. closed) iff all of the cosets in $G/H$ are open
(resp. closed). Now, the cosets $G/H$ form a disjoint cover of $G$, so
it follows that if $G/H$ is finite, $H$ is open iff $H$ is closed.

So if $H$ is closed and of finite index, $H$ is open. Conversely if
$H$ is open, the cosets $G/H$ are a disjoint \emph{open} cover of $G$,
and since $G$ is compact this implies $G/H$ must be finite, and then
$H$ must also be closed.
