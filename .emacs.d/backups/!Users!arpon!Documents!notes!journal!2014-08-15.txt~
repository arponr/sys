i started listening to harmontown. (in classic summer-arpon fashion
that means i've been doing little else.) in episode 18 harmon bares
part of his soul, reading some supremely adolescent and frankly
amazing journal entries from ages 15--16. it induced a sort of
nostalgic somber tone for the show, but it was weirder than nostalgia,
more like everybody realised they were still 15 or something. this
ended up leading into a tangent on dream pop and how dan, jeff, and
spencer enjoy melancholy music. dan said something to the effect of it
being because they were all in a relatively good place and wanted to
feel the way that music felt. sort of a callback to him saying that
when you're rich you just want to be back poor trying to get rich.

this hit home. i remember didi called james vincent mcmorrow
depressing when we were home a couple weeks ago. baba and i
disagreed. i still think depressing is the wrong word but it's
somewhere near the right track, moreso than i thought when she first
said that, and it's precisely because it's near that track that i find
jvm so beautiful. lately i've realised that it's music which makes me
really feel something which i find worth listening to. and it isn't
all the time that i want to listen - i haven't really been casually
listening to music. there are just times when i get really into some
song or something because it just brings out all the feels. as of
right now it seems like that's the real power of music to me. cavalier
by jvm or flight of the navigator by childish gambino or raven's song
by aaron embry or simple song by the shins (especially since i first
heard it in the context of the season 8 finale of himym). all this
music makes me feel something, and the same goes for the stupid shit i
write on piano. it's stupid but for a few moments it brings some
feeling out of me.

and those feels are somehow really important because so few things
seem to make me feel. harmon's adolescent journals continuously
reveal his total apathy, in particular for other people. and i think
i'm still at that apathetic fifteen year old maturity. i'm not
pretending to be some emo fall out boy kid anymore, sure, but i really
feel like i don't care about a lot of things, in particular people
right now.

listeing to that intensely emotional music sort of fills that void of
apathy for a second. so does getting caught up in tv characters. or
harmontown. or in general anything that's removed from my
reality. it's like i want to be fighting for something but i just
have anything to fight for because i just have everything you know. my
life is just so goddamn perfect and i have nothing to feel about
it. (this is harmon's segment: complaining about things i can't
complain about.)
