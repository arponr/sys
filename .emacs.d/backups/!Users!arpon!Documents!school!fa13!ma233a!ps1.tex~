\prob{1}

\subprob{First argument}

We proceed by induction. When $n=0$ the statement is exactly the
Cauchy integral formula, as proved in lecture (in the course of the
proof that complex differentiable implies analytic). Then clearly it
suffices to show that we can commute differentiation and integration
as follows:
\[
\p{}{z}\int_{\del D} \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^n}\,d\zeta =
\int_{\del D} \p{}{z}\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^n}\,d\zeta =
n\int_{\del D} \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}\,d\zeta.
\]
Since $nf(\zeta)/(\zeta-z)^{n+1}$ is a continuous function of $z$ for
$\zeta \in \del D$, the above is valid by definition of the line
integral and the following lemma from real analysis, which follows
from Fubini's theorem.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $g : A \to \R$ such that $\p{g(x,y)}{x}$ exists and is
  continuous on $A$, where $A := [a,b] \times [c,d] \subset
  \R^2$. Then on $[a,b]$,
  \[
  \p{}{x} \int_c^d g(x,y)\,dy = \int_c^d \p{g(x,y)}x\,dy.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\subprob{Second argument}

Let $z \in D$ and $n \ge 0$. By the analytic characterisation of
holomorphic functions we can choose $R > 0$ such that $\oline\Delta(z,
R) \subset D$ and
\[
f(z') = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta - z|=R}
\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^k}\,d\zeta \right) (z'-z)^k
\]
converges uniformly and absolutely for $z' \in
\oline\Delta(z,R)$. It follows then from the lemma from lecture that
we can differentiate $f$ term by term on $\oline\Delta(z,R)$, which
implies clearly that
\[
f^{(n)}(z) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta - z|=R}
\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}.
\]
Then $D - \oline\Delta(z,R)$ is a Green's domain in $U - \{z\}$, where
$f(\zeta)/(\zeta-z)^n$ is holomorphic. It follows from one of the
characterisations of complex differentiability that
\[
0 = \int_{\del(D - \oline\Delta(z,R))}
\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}\,d\zeta = \int_{\del D}
\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}\,d\zeta - \int_{|\zeta - z|=R}
\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}}\,d\zeta,
\]
which finishes the proof.

\prob{2}

Since $e^{z^n}$ is entire, by problem 1 we have
\[
\int_{|\zeta|=1} \frac{e^{\zeta^2}}{\zeta^5}\,d\zeta =
\frac{2\pi i}{5!} \left.\frac{d^5}{dz^5}\right|_{z=0}e^{z^2} =
\frac{2\pi i}{15} e^{z^2}z(4z^4 + 20z^2 + 15),
\]
and similarly (also using partial fractions), we have
\begin{align*}
\int_{|\zeta|=4} \frac{e^{\zeta}}{\zeta^2+\pi^2}\,d\zeta &=
\int_{|\zeta|=1} \frac{e^{\zeta}}{\zeta^2+\pi^2}\,d\zeta =
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta|=1} \frac{e^{\zeta}}{\zeta -
  i\pi}\,d\zeta - \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta|=1}
\frac{e^{\zeta}}{\zeta + i\pi}\,d\zeta \\
&= e^{i\pi} - e^{-i\pi} = 0.
\end{align*}
