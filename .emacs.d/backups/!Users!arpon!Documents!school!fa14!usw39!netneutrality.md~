As many as hundreds of thousands of people are currently occupying the
streets of Hong Kong, protesting recent restrictions the Chinese
government have placed on the 2017 election in Hong Kong. Notably,
these protestors have not been led by any single person, or even any
particular group or political party. Even more notable is that this
sort of large-scale and unorganized, yet somehow organized, movement
is not a surprising or isolated phenomenon in modern times. So what is
the role of leadership in protest? Is leadership necessary?

I think the key enabler of this modern decentralized organized protest
is technology, especially the far and deep reach of contemporary
social media. Any citizen of the internet personally experiences the
effect of social media in the diffusion of movements like the Hong
Kong protests. Some time has afforded more critical analyses of this
effect in another prime example of leaderless protest: the revolutions
comprising the Arab Spring. Research indicates that in these cases,
social media markedly shaped the political debates of society and
predicted "major events on the ground", suggesting its ability to
effectively (and leaderlessly) organise the public's will and
actions.[^1]

But is organization the sole function of leadership? Consider the
suffrage movement in Rhode Island in the 1830s and 40s, which also
sought to overturn policy which unfairly restricted representation in
a so-called democratic government. Also shared by the two movements
was a certain spirit and strategy of the protestors concerning
organization. In Rhode Island, an alternate constitution was drafted
and alternate leaders were elected, with great public support and more
efficiency than the established government.[^2] In Hong Kong, the
protestors have self-organized to ensure sufficient volumes in the
streets at all times, and more peculiarly, have made sure to keep the
streets clean and hygenic during the protest.[^3] While this
organization in Hong Kong is of a less official nature than in Rhode
Island, I think both have signalled to their governments that their
movement is serious, rational, and popular.

A crucial distinction is that the Rhode Island suffrage movement was
for the most part led by one man, Thomas Dorr. Dorr essentially ended
up failing (in the short-term), landing himself in prison. His
mistakes highlight a potentially key role of leadership. When
suffragists began to be arrested in Rhode Island, more moderate
protestors began to drop out, radicalizing the movement---and Dorr
stuck to this radicalization.[^4] Thus, when the established
government offered almost everything the suffragists desired,
compromise was ignored as a possible solution. This radicalization and
failure to compromise was, in my opinion, Dorr's fatal mistake. In
such a matter of obtaining fairer democratic representation, even
compromise can grant a movement a significant amount of leverage in
the government, and hence a legal and peaceful way to enact desired
reforms more fully in the long-term.

This case in Rhode Island then suggests two lessons: the plain
existence of seemingly qualified leadership is not sufficient for
successful protest; but something more than organization is
necessary. In particular, *moderation*, i.e. a willingness to
compromise, seems to be quite important. While technology and social
media do offer the ability to organize without leadership, I don't
think they foster the type of moderation needed to negotiate
compromise. For, it seems that that average protestor occupies the
streets out of an identification of principles or values with the
movement, rather than a practical or political mindset towards
achieving their goals. Relatedly, the average protestor is probably
relatively short-sighted and impatient, while compromise may be a
long-term solution. So it seems leaderless movements, though
organized, may be vulnerable to being too principled, stubborn, or
short-sighted. Hopefully the situation in Hong Kong will be resolved
peacefully through a moderated negotiation, but I believe some sort of
leadership must emerge in the protestors to facilitate this.

Does the emergence of leaderless protest say something about political
leadership more generally? Perhaps the proliferation and advancement
of technology can make a more direct democracy more feasible and
organised too. But the same concerns I have expressed about the
average protestor should also apply to the average citizen, explaining
why more direct forms of government might be more erratic and
over-reactive in the short-term. Yet historical cases, like New York's
budget balancing during major public works projects and economic
recessions in the mid-19th centry, suggest that this erratic behaviour
can be productive, and sort of moderate itself in the long-term.[^5]
So, as we move forward, the role of leadership may naturally shift
focus away from organization, towards establishing some optimal
framework of moderation.
