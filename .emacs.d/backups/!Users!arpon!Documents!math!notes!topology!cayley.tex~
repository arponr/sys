\section{Setting up}

\begin{nothing}
  For the remainder we fix a nice pointed space $(X,x)$. Sometimes we
  won't use the basepoint, and sometimes we will. Here \emph{nice}
  means that $X$ is connected, locally path connected, and semilocally
  simply connected.
\end{nothing}

\begin{definition}
  \label{covering}
  A map $p : E \to X$ of spaces is a \emph{covering} if each $x \in X$
  has an open neighbourhood $U$ such that $p^{-1}(U) = \coprod_{j \in
    J} V_j$, where $J \ne \emptyset$ and for each $j \in J$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $V_j \subseteq E$ is open,
  \item the restriction $p : V_j \to U$ is a homeomorphism.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remarks}
  (\ref{covering}) is just how one formalises the idea that $E$
  locally looks like a bunch of copies of $X$. Note we'll often be
  abusive and refer to $E$ as a covering, leaving the map $p$
  implicit.
\end{remarks}

\newcommand{\Cov}{\operatorname{Cov}}
\newcommand{\Gal}{\operatorname{Gal}}

\begin{definition}
  We define $\Cov(X)$, the \emph{category of coverings of $X$}, as
  follows.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item An object of $\Cov(X)$ is a covering $p : E \to X$.
  \item A \emph{morphism of coverings} from $p : E \to X$ to $p' : E'
    \to X$ is given by a map $f : E \to E'$ such that $p'f = p$, i.e.,
    a commutative diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      E \ar{rr}{f} \drar[swap]{p} & & E'. \dlar{p'} \\ & X &
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{nothing}
  As one might expect, we call a based map $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ a
  covering if the underlying unbased map $p : E \to X$ is a
  covering. Similarly if $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ and $p' : (E',e') \to
  (X,x)$ are coverings, we will call $f : (E,e) \to (E',e')$ a
  morphism of coverings simply if the underlying $f : E \to E'$ is a
  morphism of coverings as defined above.
\end{nothing}

\begin{notation}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Denote the interval $[0,1]$ by $I$.
  \item Denote by $\pi_1(Y,y)$ the fundamental group of a pointed
    space $(Y,y)$.
  \item If we write an element $g \in \pi_1(Y,y)$ as $[\gamma]$, we
    mean that $g$ is the homotopy class of the loop $\gamma : I \to Y$
    based at $y$.
  \item Denote by $f_* : \pi_1(Y,y) \to \pi_1(Y',y')$ the group
    homomorphism induced by a map of pointed spaces $f : (Y,y) \to
    (Y',y')$.
  \item Denote $\pi_1(X,x)$ by $G$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}

\section{Lifting things}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{general-lifting}
  Let $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ be a covering. Let $f : (Y,y) \to (X,x)$
  be a map of pointed spaces.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a lift $\tilde f : (Y,y) \to (E,e)$ making the
    diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \ & (E,e) \dar{p} \\ (Y,y) \rar{f} \ar[dashed]{ur}{\tilde f} &
      (X,x)
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    commute if and only if $\im(f_*) \subseteq \im(p_*)$.
  \item If $Y$ is connected and the lift $\tilde f$ does exist, then
    it is unique.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The fibre functor}

One of the mottos in this theory, which will surely become clear, is
that everything is determined by the fibres.

\begin{definition}
  If $p : E \to X$ is a covering, we denote, somewhat abusively, the
  \emph{fibre} $p^{-1}(x)$ by $F_x(E)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{pi1-action}
  If $p : E \to X$ is a covering, there is a canonical $G$-action on
  the fibre $F_x(E)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $e \in F_x(E)$ and $g = [\gamma] \in G$. Then by a lifting
  lemma, $\gamma$ lifts uniquely to a path $\tilde\gamma : I \to E$
  with $\gamma(0) = e$. Then $p\tilde\gamma(1) = \gamma(1) = x
  \implies \tilde\gamma(1) \in F_x(E)$. We define the action by $g
  \cdot e \coloneqq \tilde\gamma(1)$.

  \medskip
  \textbf{Check that this is independent of the loop
    representative. This should probably be a lemma in the Lifting
    things section}.

  \medskip
  Now if $g = \id_G$ then we can take $\gamma$ to be the constant loop
  at $x$, which clearly lifts to $\tilde\gamma$ the constant loop at
  $e$. Thus $\id_G \cdot e = \tilde\gamma(1) = e$.

  Finally let $h = [\delta] \in G$. Then $\delta$ lifts to a unique
  $\tilde\delta : I \to E$ satisfying $\tilde\delta(0) = g \cdot
  e$. By definition, $h \cdot (g \cdot e) = \tilde\delta(1)$. But note
  that the composition $\tilde\delta \cdot \tilde\gamma$ is a lift of
  the composition $\delta \cdot \gamma$. Since $hg = [\delta \cdot
    \gamma]$, it follows that also $hg \cdot e =
  \tilde\delta(1)$. Thus we indeed have a $G$-action.
\end{proof}

\begin{nothing}
  \label{fibre-map}
  Let $p : E \to X$ and $p' : E' \to X$ be coverings, and $f : E \to
  E'$ a morphism of coverings. By definition, $f$ restricts to a map
  of sets $F_x(f) : F_x(E) \to F_x(E')$. Let $e,g,\gamma,\gamma'$ as
  above. Then $f\gamma' : I \to E'$ is a lift of $\gamma$ at
  $f(e)$. So by uniqueness of lifting we must have $gf(e) =
  f(ge)$. I.e., $F_x(f)$ is a morphism of $G$-sets.
\end{nothing}

\begin{definition}
  (\ref{pi1-action}) and (\ref{fibre-map}) define for us the
  \emph{fibre functor}
  \[
  F_x : \Cov(X) \to G\text{-}\Set.
  \]
\end{definition}

\section{Classifying coverings}

Now we're going to sit down and classify all of the coverings of
$X$. This stuff is beautiful, I hope I can convey that.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{cover-injection}
  Let $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ a covering. Then $p_* : \pi_1(E,e) \to
  \pi_1(X,x)$ is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $[\gamma] \in \pi_1(E,e)$ the homotopy class of a loop $\gamma :
  I \to Y$ at $y$. By definition, $p_*[\gamma] = [p\gamma]$. Suppose
  $[\gamma] \in \ker(p_*)$. Then there's a null-homotopy (through
  loops) $h : I \times I \to X$ of $p\gamma$. But by a lifting lemma,
  this lifts to $h' : I \times I \to Y$ with $h'(0,0) = y$ and, for $t
  \in I$,
  \begin{align*}
    ph'(0,t) = h(0,t) = x, \quad &ph'(1,t) = h(1,t) = x, \\ ph'(t,0) =
    h(t,0) = p\gamma(t), \quad &ph'(t,1) = h(t,1) = x.
  \end{align*}
  By uniqueness of lifting this implies $h'(0,t) = h'(1,t) = h'(t,1) =
  y$ and $h'(t,0) = \gamma(t)$ for $t \in I$. I.e., $h'$ is a
  null-homotopy of $\gamma$, and hence $[\gamma] =
  \id_{\pi_1(Y,y)}$. Thus $\ker(p_*)$ is trivial, implying the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
  Let $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ is a covering. We will use the following
  notation for the remainder:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
  \item $H(E,e) \coloneqq p_*\pi_1(E,e) \subseteq G$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Note that (\ref{cover-injection}) says that $H(E,e) \simeq
  \pi_1(E,e)$.
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $p : (E,e) \to (X,x)$ and $p' : (E',e') \to (X,x)$
  coverings.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a morphism of coverings $f : (E,e) \to (E',e')$
    if and only if $H(E,e) \subseteq H(E',e')$.
  \item If $E$ is connected and the morphism $f$ does exist, then it
    is unique.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This is immediate from (\ref{general-lifting}).
\end{proof}
