title: Harvard-Cambridge Scholarship Proposal
---

For most of high school I was banging away at keyboards, convinced
that programming was my vocation and singularly engaged by my research
in computationally modeling phenomena in materials science. Yet at
times I found myself slightly dissatisfied: my models produced
qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable simulations, but why?
Trying to answer this question led me to learn a bit of statistical
mechanics and its underlying mathematics. I distinctly remember
finally understanding something about differential equations on the
back of a receipt during a materials science lecture, and just
jittering deliriously in my seat. Moments like this enkindled further
curiosity about pure mathematics, and I ended up working through a
book on the rigorous foundations of calculus as an on-and-off side
project during my senior year.

The resources and opportunities at Harvard allowed me to tie these
loose strands of curiosity into a knot of utter mathematical zeal at
my core. It all began when I decided to give the infamous Math 55 a go
in my first semester and, well, I just kept going. I was exhilarated
learning from and collaborating with brilliant, driven classmates; my
closest friendships came about not over coffee or at parties, but over
mathematics in a basement which we gladly called home. Before I knew
it, I was spending at least thirty hours per week thinking about math
(and probably another thirty hours per week dreaming about it).

My experience in Math 55 inspired me to spend the following summer
learning some mathematics with Prof. Joe Harris, which learning
allowed me to take a life-changing sequence of graduate courses in my
sophomore year, which courses motivated my friend and I to engage in
some uniquely fun independent reading with Dr. Emily Riehl in our
junior fall, which reading encouraged me to spend this past summer
immersing myself in some miraculous mathematics with Prof. Jacob
Lurie, which immersion has brought me to my present thesis work with
Prof. Lurie. Which is all to say that my time at Harvard has radically
shifted my perspective on and relationship with mathematics: in place
of the haphazard set of computations and problem-solving techniques I
saw before college, I now see a language that reveals fundamental
structures through abstraction, and over the past three years I have
chosen to invest a basically absurd portion of my time in
understanding and teaching the fascinating stories expressed by this
language.

I hope the rattling length of the previous two sentences conveys,
though, just how quickly this time has gone by, and how startling it
is to find myself so absorbed in mathematics, even specific subfields,
when the subject was nothing more than a side project a little while
ago. This is why, mathematically and academically speaking, I am so
excited about the opportunity to spend next year at Cambridge for Part
III. The diverse faculty and course offering of Cambridge's math
department makes it an ideal setting for stepping back and slowing
down, broadening and solidifying my foundation in mathematics. A year
there would furnish me with invaluable resources for studying the
stories in mathematics that I find the most engaging: those connecting
myriad ideas and revealing deep, universal structures. As just one
illustrative example, some of the mathematics related to my thesis has
fascinating interpretations in physics which I'm yearning to learn
about, and a few courses in mathematical physics being offered for
Part III next year would give me the perfect tools for understanding
these interpretations.

However, the allure of a year at Cambridge is not solely academic: I
believe the utterly new environment---both the Cambridge math
department replacing the Harvard math department and Cambridge, UK
replacing Cambridge, MA---will be crucial in inducing a certain
creative break in routine which I am looking for. In terms of
exploration and exploitation, I think I've done a pretty excellent job
exploiting the mathematical resources at Harvard. Recently, though, I
have been jolted by inspiration not only in mathematics but in
web-programming and music- and fiction-writing. I live and work
precisely for these jolts, and yet I've ended up feeling incredibly
guilty after spending entire Saturdays this semester wringing songs
out of my brain or obsessively redesigning my website, simply because
it means I wasn't working on my assignments. So, complementing the
chance to step back and slow down academically, the Harvard-Cambridge
Scholarship would afford me a truly (guilt-)free year to explore my
inspiration, whatever it may be at the given moment.
