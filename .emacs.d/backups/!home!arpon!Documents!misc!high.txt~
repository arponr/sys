I want to move west.

I don't mean one or two centimetres, I mean goddamn manifest
destiny. Do I have the right to manifest destiny, despite choosing to
measure in centimetres and spelling centimetres in this godless
fashion?

I hope so. There's a force acting upon me, from the east. It's not a
hurricane, and it's not god. It's something much humbler and more
meaningless. It's growing tired of this cold ocean. This ocean of
cold, which creeps up on to the shore like no one is watching. Of
course everybody is watching, but everybody is stuck, and what could
we do?
