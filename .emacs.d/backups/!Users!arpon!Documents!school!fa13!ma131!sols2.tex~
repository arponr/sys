\section{Characterisation of open sets in $\R$}

Here are two solutions. The first is the one Alex and I knew before
speaking to Prof. McMullen a couple of days ago, and is the one we
hinted at if you came to office hours or section. The second is (I
believe) the one Prof. McMullen had in mind, which is a bit cleaner
(sorry for the suboptimal hinting!).

\subsection{Existence via equivalence relation}

For $x,y \in U$ write $x \sim y$ if and only if there exists an open
interval $I \subseteq U$ such that $x, y \in I$. We show $\sim$ is an
equivalence relation.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Reflexivity.} Let $x \in U$. Since the open intervals
  form a basis for the topology on $\R$ (and $U$ is open) we can find
  an open interval $I \subseteq U$ with $x \in I$. So $x \sim x$.
\item \textit{Symmetry.} Tautological.
\item \textit{Transitivity.} Let $x,y,z \in U$ such that $x \sim y$
  and $y \sim z$. By definition there are open intervals $I,J
  \subseteq U$ such that $x,y \in I$ and $y,z \in J$. Since $y \in I
  \cap J$ and $x,z \in I \cup J$, we have $x \sim z$ by the following
  lemma.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{interval-union}
  Let $I,J \subseteq \R$ open intervals with $I \cap J \ne
  \emptyset$. Then $I \cup J$ is an open interval.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Write $I =: (a_1,b_1)$ and $J =: (a_2,b_2)$, and without loss of
  generality $a_1 \le a_2$. Since $I \cap J \ne \emptyset$, we must
  have $b_1 > a_2$. It follows that $I \cup J = (a_1, \max(b_1,b_2))$.
\end{proof}

Now let $x \in U$ and let $U_x := \{y \in U \mid x \sim y\}$ its
equivalence class. We claim $U_x = (a, b)$ where $a := \inf U_x$ and
$b := \sup U_x$ (where we allow $a = -\infty$ and $b = \infty$).

Let $y \in (a, b)$. Suppose $y < x$. By definition of $\inf$ we can
choose $a' \in (a, y) \cap U_x$. Thus there exists an open interval $I
\subseteq U$ such that $a', x \in I$. But then $a' < y < x \implies
y \in I$, so $y \in I$ and thus $y \in U_x$. We have a symmetric
argument when $y > x$, and of course $x \in U_x$, so $(a, b) \subseteq
U_x$.

By definition of $\inf$ and $\sup$ it only remains to be shown that
$a,b \notin U_x$. Assume $a \in U_x$. Then there exists an open
interval $I \subseteq U$ such that $a,x \in I$. Since $I$ is open
there must exist $a' \in I \cap (-\infty, a)$. But then $a' \in U_x$,
contradicting that $a = \inf U_x$. A symmetric argument shows $b
\notin U_x$, and hence $U_x = (a,b)$.

Then observe that $U$ is partitioned into disjoint sets by the
equivalence classes $\{U_x\}_{x \in U}$, each of which we have shown
is an open interval.

\subsection{Existence via maximal intervals}

For $x \in U$ define:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a_x := \inf \{a \in \R \mid (a,x] \subseteq U\}$;
\item $b_x := \sup \{b \in \R \mid [x,b) \subseteq U\}$;
\item $I_x := (a_x, b_x)$.
\end{itemize}
Note the above are well-defined because $U$ is open and hence there
exists an open interval $I \subseteq U$ with $x \in U$. By definition
of $\inf$ and $\sup$ we have $I_x \subseteq U$, and of course $x \in
U$. Thus $U = \bigcup_{x \in U} I_x$. We need only show then that if
$y \in U - I_x$ then $I_x \cap I_y = \emptyset$. Assume the
contrary. By Lemma~\ref{interval-union}, $I_x \cup I_y = (a,b)$. Since
$y \in I_y - I_x$ we must have either $a < a_x$ or $b > b_x$, but this
contradicts the definitions of $a_x, b_x$.

\subsection{Uniqueness}

Suppose $U = \coprod_{\alpha \in A} I_\alpha = \coprod_{\beta \in B}
J_\beta$ are two decompositions of $U$ into disjoint open
intervals. We want that $\{I_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} =
\{J_\beta\}_{\beta \in B}$; by symmetry it suffices to show for each
$\alpha \in A$ there exists $\beta \in B$ such that $J_\beta =
I_\alpha$. So let $\alpha \in A$, and let $I_\alpha =: (a,b)$. Let $x
\in (a,b)$; since $x \in U$ we can pick $\beta \in B$ such that $x \in
J_\beta =: (c,d)$. Then $(a,b) \cap (c,d) \ne \emptyset$, whence
either $a \in (c,d)$ or $c \in (a,b)$. In the first case, $a \in U
\implies a \in I_{\alpha'}$ for some $\alpha' \in A - \{\alpha\}$. But
then since $I_{\alpha'}$ is open we must have $I_{\alpha'} \cap
I_\alpha \ne \emptyset$, contradicting disjointness. The second case
is treated in the same way.

\begin{remark}
  Note that uniqueness is not immediate from either of the above
  proofs for existence, as far as I can tell.\footnote{If I am being
    dumb and it actually is immediate, come convince me and I'll fix
    my grading.} In particular for the proof via equivalence relation,
  it's not a priori clear that any decomposition into disjoint
  intervals must precisely agree with the decomposition under the
  defined equivalence relation.
\end{remark}

\section{Continuous functions from the cofinite topology}

The point is that $\R$ is Hausdorff but $X$ is really far from being
Hausdorff. Indeed, recall from lecture that any two nonempty open (
i.e., cofinite) subsets of $X$ have cofinite, hence nonempty (since
$X$ is infinite!), intersection.

Suppose $f : X \to \R$ is a nonconstant function. Choose $x,y \in
f(X)$ distinct. By Hausdorffness we can choose $U,V \subseteq \R$
disjoint opens with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. Then
\[
f^{-1}(U) \cap f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(U \cap V) = f^{-1}(\emptyset) =
\emptyset,
\]
so $f^{-1}(U), f^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint. Thus by the above, we cannot
have both $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ open in $X$. Therefore $f$ is
not continuous.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.13, Exercise 1}

Let $U_x \subseteq A$ an open set containing $x$ for $x \in A$. Then
$U := \bigcup_{x \in X} U_x$ is a union of open sets and hence
open. But $U \subseteq A$ since $U_x \subseteq A$ for $x \in A$, and
$x \in U_x \subseteq U$ for $x \in A$, so $A = U$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.13, Exercise 4}

\subsection*{(a)}

We show the necessary three properties for $\bigcap T_\alpha$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Firstly $\emptyset, X \in \T_\alpha$ since $T_\alpha$ a topology
  for each $\alpha$. Thus $\emptyset, X \in \bigcap T_\alpha$.
\item Next let $\{U_i\} \subseteq \bigcap T_\alpha$. Then for each
  $\alpha$ we have $U_i \in \T_\alpha$ for each $i$, so $\bigcup U_i
  \in \T_\alpha$ since $T_\alpha$ a topology. Thus $\bigcup U_i \in
  \bigcap \T_\alpha$.
\item Finally let let $\{U_i\} \subseteq \bigcap T_\alpha$ a finite
  subset. Then for each $\alpha$ we have $U_i \in \T_\alpha$ for each
  $i$, so $\bigcap U_i \in \T_\alpha$ since $T_\alpha$ a
  topology. Thus $\bigcap U_i \in \bigcap \T_\alpha$.
\end{itemize}

That was pretty trivial, but it doesn't work for $\bigcup T_\alpha$,
which is not necessarily a topology! For a minimal counterexample
consider $X := \{x, y, z\}$ and the two topologies
\[
\T_1 := \{\emptyset, \{x\}, X\} \quad\text{and}\quad \T_2 :=
\{\emptyset, \{y\}, X\}.
\]
Then $\{x\}, \{y\} \in \T_1 \cup \T_2$ but $\{x, y\} \notin \T_1 \cup
\T_2$.

\subsection*{(b)}

Note $\bigcup \T_\alpha$ is clearly a subbasis, and hence we can
consider $\T$ the topology generated by $\bigcup \T_\alpha$. By \S
2.13, exercise 5 (see below), $\T$ is the minimal topology containing
$\bigcup \T_\alpha$, i.e. the minimal topology containing $\T_\alpha$
for all $\alpha$.

If $\T$ is a topology such that $\T \subseteq \T_\alpha$ for all
$\alpha$, then $\T \subseteq \bigcap \T_\alpha$. But in (a) we showed
that $\bigcap T_\alpha$ is a topology, whence it must be the maximal
topology contained in all $\T_\alpha$.

\subsection*{(c)}

By (b) the minimal topology containing $\T_1$ and $\T_2$ is
$\{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}, \{b,c\}, X\}$ and the maximal
contained in $\T_1$ and $\T_2$ is $\{\emptyset, \{a\}, X\}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newcommand{\A}{\mathcal{A}}

\section{Munkres \S 2.13, Exercise 5}

By definition any basis is a subbasis, so it suffices to prove the
claim for $\A$ a subbasis. Let $\T$ the topology generated by
$\A$. Let $\T' \supseteq \A$ is a toplogy on $X$. Since $\T'$ is
closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions, $\T' \supseteq
\T$ by definition of the topology generated by a subbasis. Thus $\T$
is a topology containing $\A$ and is contained in any topology
containing $\A$; hence it is the intersection of all topologies
containing $\A$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.16, Exercise 1}

Let $\T_X,\T_Y$ the topologies on $A$ induced by the topologies on
$X,Y$, respectively. By definition, $U \in \T_Y$ if and only if $U = V
\cap A$ for some $V \subseteq Y$ open. Since the topology on $Y$ is
induced by the topology on $X$, this holds if and only if $U = W \cap
Y \cap A = W \cap A$ for some $W \subseteq X$ open. By definition this
holds if and only if $U \in \T_X$. Thus $\T_X = \T_Y$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.16, Exercise 3}

\begin{itemize}
\item $A = (-1, -1/2) \cup (1/2, 1)$ is a union of open intervals
  contained in $Y$, hence is open in $\R$ and in $Y$.
\item $B = [-1, -1/2) \cup (1/2, 1]$ is not open in $\R$ but $B = (-2,
  -1/2) \cup (1/2, 2) \cap Y$ so is open in $Y$.
\item $C = (-1, -1/2] \cup [1/2, 1)$ is not open in $\R$ or in $Y$
  since any open set in $\R$ containing $1/2$ must contain some $x \in
  (0, 1/2)$.
\item $D = [-1, -1/2] \cup [1/2, 1]$ is not open in $\R$ or in $Y$ by
  the same reason given for $C$.
\item $E = (-1, 0) \cup \bigcup_{n \in \Z_+} (\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac
  1n)$ is a union of open intervals contained in $Y$, hence is open in
  $\R$ and in $Y$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.16, Exercise 4}

Since $\pi_i(\bigcup U_\alpha) = \bigcup \pi_i(U_\alpha)$ and unions
of open sets are open, it suffices to show $\pi_i(U)$ is open for $U$
a basic open set $U_1 \times U_2$, where $U_1 \subseteq X$ and $U_2
\subseteq U$ is open. But then clearly $\pi_i(U) = U_i$ and we're
done.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.16, Exercise 8}

I didn't look for, nor will I write up, a fully rigorous solution to
this problem (mostly because such a solution would be a fantastic
waste of trees\footnote{Or, in the case of this solution set,
  electronic trees (terminology due to Alex).}). The point is that $L$
is homeomorphic to $\R$, and if we look at how basic opens in each
product intersect with $L$ we can see the topology on $\R$ induced by
the topology on $L$. In $\R_\ell \times \R$ the basic opens are of the
form $[a,b) \times (c,d)$, and in $\R_\ell \times \R_\ell$ the basic
opens are of the form $[a,b) \times [c,d)$. Maybe we draw some
pictures then, and convince ourselves of the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $L$ is horizontal: in both $\R_\ell \times \R$ and $\R_\ell
  \times \R_\ell$ the topology we get is $\R_\ell$. (Intuitively,
  horizontal lines inherit the topology of the first factor in the
  product.)
\item If $L$ is vertical: in $\R_\ell \times \R$ we get $\R$ and in
  $\R_\ell \times \R_\ell$ we get $\R_\ell$. (Intuitively, vertical
  lines inherit the topology of the first factor in the product.)
\item If $L$ has positive slope: in both $\R_\ell \times \R$ and
  $\R_\ell \times \R_\ell$ we get $\R_\ell$.
\item If $L$ has negative slope: in $\R_\ell \times \R$ we get
  $\R_\ell$ and in $\R_\ell \times \R_\ell$ we get the discrete
  topology. (The discrete topology comes from the fact that a line of
  negative slope can intersect only the bottom left corner of a
  square.)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.17, Exercise 3}

We have
\[
X \times Y - A \times B = (X - A) \times Y \cup X \times (Y - B).
\]
Since $A,B$ are closed we know $X-A, Y-B$ are open, whence the right
hand side is the union of two basic open sets in the product topology
on $X \times Y$. Therefore $X \times Y - A \times B$ is open, and
hence $A \times B$ is closed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.17, Exercise 6}

\subsection*{(a)}

Let $x \in \oline A$. Any open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ intersects
$A$, hence intersects $B$ (since $A \subseteq B$). Thus $x \in \oline
B$. This shows $\oline A \subseteq \oline B$.

\subsection*{(b)}

By (a), $\oline A, \oline B \subseteq \oline{A \cup B} \implies \oline
A \cup \oline B \subseteq \oline{A \cup B}$. But $\oline A \cup \oline
B$ is closed since finite unions of closed sets are closed, so $A \cup
B \subseteq \oline A \cup \oline B \implies \oline{A \cup B} \subseteq
\oline A \cup \oline B$ by definition of closure. Thus $\oline A \cup
\oline B = \oline{A \cup B}$.

\subsection*{(c)}

We have $\bigcup \oline{A_\alpha} \subseteq \oline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$
by the same argument as (b), that is, using (a). The other direction
of (b) doesn't carry over because infinite unions of closed sets are
necessarily closed, so that's where the following counterexample comes
from. Let $A_n := \R - (-1/n, 1/n)$, which is closed by definition,
for $n \in \N$. Then $\bigcup_{n \in \N} \oline{A_n} = \bigcup_{n \in
  \N} A_n = \R - \{0\}$, but $\oline{\bigcup_{n \in \N} A_n} =
\oline{\R - \{0\}} = \R$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 2.17, Exercise 8}

\subsection*{(a)}

See (b).

\subsection*{(b)}

Since $\bigcap A_\alpha \subseteq A_\alpha \implies \oline{\bigcap
  A_\alpha} \subseteq \oline{A_\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$ by \S 2.16,
exercise 6 (see above), we have $\oline{\bigcap A_\alpha} \subseteq
\bigcap \oline A_\alpha$. For a counterexample to the other direction
observe, let $A := (-1, 0)$ and $B := (0, 1)$; then we have
\[
\oline A \cap \oline B = [-1, 0] \cap [0, 1] = \{0\}
\quad\text{but}\quad \oline{A \cap B} = \oline\emptyset = \emptyset.
\]

\subsection*{(c)}

Suppose $x \in \oline A - \oline B$. Then there exists an open
neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ such that $V \cap B = \emptyset$. Let $U$ any
open neighbourhood of $x$. Then $U \cap V$ is an open neighbourhood of
$x$, so $U \cap V \cap A \ne \emptyset$ since $x \in \oline A$. This
implies $U \cap A - B \ne \emptyset$ by choice of $V$. Thus $x \in
\oline{A - B}$, whence we have show $\oline A - \oline B \subseteq
\oline{A-B}$.

For a counterexample to the other direction, consider $A := [0, 1]$
and $B := \{0\}$. Then $A$ and $B$ are closed so
\[
\oline A - \oline B = A - B = (0, 1] \quad\text{but}\quad \oline{A -
  B} = \oline{(0, 1]} = [0, 1].
\]
