*Why do you think you'd want to take this course?*

I want to know what David Foster Wallace has to say. At first this
want just stemmed from all the "fuss" about his work, but being
exposed to a tiny bit of him---I just mean a couple of his essays and
what we saw in the first lecture---has made this want slightly less
superficial. I watch and rewatch inordinate amounts of television; I
feel spoiled and lazy and alienated from my parents and reality
because of my constant expectation of fun; and I'm confused about
what's important to me and how okay it is to escape into stories
(including math). So I think I identify with parts of Wallace, or at
least I'm thinking about some things he seems to be thinking about in
his work. Hence I'm interested in what he has to say about these
things, and how he manages to say them.

*Have you read any DFW before? Where? Why? Thoughts?*

I've only read two short pieces of his, "Federer as Religious
Experience" and "Tennis, Trigonometry, Tornadoes". I figured I should
read at least something of his before coming in to the course, and I
both play tennis and closely follow professional tennis so I was
naturally drawn to these. In both I was captivated by his relationship
to tennis, maybe because I've never read any writing quite like this
about *tennis* before. And I was struck by the intricate pattern
weaved with tennis, math, and weather in "Tennis, Trigonometry,
Tornadoes", in particular the singular point he describes at the end,
as the "tornado" funnels away his sense of all three.

*What other English or literature or creative writing classes have you
taken?*

Just one class on Russian literature: "A&I 41: How and what Russia
learned to read".

*Please rank your interest according ot the following scale:*

- I will memorize all 1,079 pages of *Infinite Jest* if I have to
- I won’t actually memorize it, but I’ll happily pretend to if it gets
  me a spot
- **I’m like 90% sure I want to take this class**
- More like 50/50
- Meh.
- Wait, I thought this was supposed to be a Hasty Pudding audition

# Essay

"Temperatures were uterine." This is how David Foster Wallace chooses
to describe the Caribbean weather on a luxury cruise in his essay,
"Shipping Out". When met on page two of the essay, this choice is
puzzling, or at least arresting. But in the context of the entire
piece the choice is entirely fitting, and hardly isolated. Throughout
the essay, images of mother and child are evoked to describe the
responsibility-effacing and awareness-numbing coddling, or
"pampering", one experiences on a luxury cruise.

The word uterine suggests that the Caribbean cruise environment
provides warmth in the same sense that a womb enveloping a fetus
does. A similar comparison is made when the corridor between the port
and the ship is described as an "umbilical passage". These phrases are
found amidst more expected descriptions like "The food was beyond
belief, the service unimpeachable...", "the big gray doors", and "wall
of total white metal". The jarring interruptions of "uterine" and
"umbilical" indicate that there is something stranger or more subtle
that Wallace experiences in these scenes.  I.e., these small, unusual
word choices establish a certain tone in Wallace's description of the
cruise, a tone that is gradually spelled out more explicitly over the
course of the essay. For instance, he later observes, "I finally see
what it is about heavy seas and marvelous rest: in heavy seas you feel
rocked to sleep, the windows' spume a gentle shushing, engines' throb
a mother's pulse."

A comparison to the protection and comfort of a mother's womb or lap
could be made in a completely positive way, but this is not what is
intimated by Wallace's account. The comparison is used instead to
highlight the cruise's ability to reduce a person to an unaware, fetal
consumer of its environment, or a thoughtless, infantile mechanism of
want. While the mother indeed provides total protection and comfort,
she does so thanklessly, for "[i]n response to any environment of
extraordinary gratification and pampering, the insatiable [infant]
will simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out
at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction."  Wallace describes
this effect as the "falsehood at the dark heart" of the luxury
cruise. This falsehood of inevitable need and want is what drives the
unrelenting crying of an infant, and what drives Wallace to envy
fantasised pillow mints on another ship and feel that the lack of
Mr. Pibb on the ship is an "absolute goddamned travesty".

Note that this reduction to infantile unawareness and desire is also
described as something animalistic: "Looking down from a great height
at your countrymen waddling into poverty-stricken ports in expensive
sandals ... There is something inescapably *bovine* about a herd of
American tourists in motion, a certain greedy placidity." This greedy
placidity is precisely the infantile condition discussed above, so
Wallace's comparison also brings to mind the basically animalistic
unconciousness of the fetus or infant.

Thus Wallace's description of the temperatures as "uterine" fits into
this pervading analogy between the cruise and womb. Enveloped by the
mother, the fetus or infant is unaware of reality outside itself, and
simply wants and gets and wants because this is all it can
imagine. The analogy expresses Wallace's fear that the absurd
pampering of the luxury cruise (or more generally perhaps any
resignation to pure entertainment), promising to leave people with
absolutely nothing to worry about, in fact leaves people just wanting
and getting and wanting, which to Wallace is "a week of absolutely
nothing."
