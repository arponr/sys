\prob{1}

Let $\alpha \ce \sqrt{-d} \in \C$. Let $\Lambda \ce
\Z[\alpha] \subseteq \C$. Let $X \ce \C/\Lambda$. Since
$\alpha\Lambda \subseteq \Lambda$, we have a holomorphic map $f \colon
X \to X$ induced by the map $\C \to \C$ sending $z \mapsto \alpha
z$. As discussed in lecture, $f$ has degree $|\alpha|^2 = d$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{2}

Suppose $f \colon \Delta \to \C$ is a proper holomorphic map. For $R >
0$ let $D_R \ce \{z \in \C \colon |z| \le R\}$; since $f$ is
proper, we have $f^{-1}(D_R) \subseteq D_r$ for some $0 < r < 1$. This
implies $\lim_{z \to a} |f(z)| = \infty$ for every $a \in S^1 =
\del\Delta$. Since $f$ is proper it has finite degree, and hence has
finitely many zeros $z_1,\ldots,z_k \in \Delta$, say of orders
$n_1,\ldots,n_k \in \N$. Consider $g \colon \Delta \to \C$ defined by
\[
g(z) \ce \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (z-z_i)^{n_i}}{f(z)}.
\]
Then clearly $\lim_{z \to a} g(z) = 0$ for $a \in S^1$, so $g$ extends
continuous to $\oline\Delta$, vanishing on the boundary. But then
since $g$ is not identically zero, $g$ must achieve its maximum on
$\Delta$, contradicting the maximum principle.

\prob{3}

Define
\begin{align*}
  A &\ce \{(x,y) \in \C^2 \mid y^2 = (x^2-2)(x^4-1)\},\\ B
  &\ce \{(x,y) \in \C^2 \mid y^2 = (x-2)(x^2-1)\}.
\end{align*}
The completions of $A$ and $B$ are compact Riemann surfaces $X$ and
$Y$ of genus $2$ and $1$, respectively. We have an evident nonconstant
holomorphic map $A \to B$ given by $(x,y) \mapsto (x^2,y)$, which
completes to the desired map $X \to Y$.

\prob{4}

\newcommand{\mult}{\operatorname{mult}}

Suppose $G \ce \Aut(X/Y) \simeq \Z/3$ and $x \in X$ has
$\mult(f,x) = 2$. Let $y \ce f(x)$. Since $\deg(f) = 3$ and $X$
and $Y$ are compact (so $f$ is proper), we must have $F \ce
f^{-1}(y) = \{x,x'\}$ where $\mult(f,x') = 1$. Since $|G| = 3$ and
$|F| = 2$, it must be that $x,x'$ are fixed by $G$. But then $G$ could
not send a small open neighbourhood of $x'$ to a neighbourhood of $x$,
hence could not act transitively on $X^*$, and hence we could not have
$G \simeq \Z/3$, contradiction.

The converse is false. To prove this we use the following fact.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{cover-pullback}
  Let $p \colon E \to B$ and $f \colon B' \to B$ be maps of
  spaces. Let $E' \ce E \times_B B'$ be the pullback and $p' :
  E' \to B'$ the projection. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item if $p$ is a covering then $p'$ is;
  \item if moreover $f$ is a retraction then $\Aut(E/B) \simeq
    \Aut(E'/B')$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item  Assume $p$ is a covering. Let $b \in B'$ and let $U \ni
    f(b)$ be an open neighbourhood such that $p^{-1}(U) = \coprod_{i
      \in I} V_i$ where $p : V_i \to U$ is a homeomorphism for $i \in
    I$. Let $U' \ce f^{-1}(U)$ and $q \colon E' \to E$ the
    projection. Then
    \[
    \textstyle{p'^{-1}(U') = q^{-1}(\coprod_{i \in I} V_i) =
      \coprod_{i \in I} q^{-1}(V_i)}
    \]
    Now $V'_i \ce q^{-1}(V_i) \simeq V_i \times_U U'$, so since
    isomorphisms are stable under pullback, $q : V'_i \to U'$ is a
    homeomorphism for $i \in I$. This proves $p'$ is a covering.

  \item Assume there is a map $g : B \to B'$ such that $fg =
    \id_B$. Let $h \ce gp \colon E \to B'$. Then we have the
    retract diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = large]
      E \rar{\id_E \times h} \dar{p} & E' \dar{p'} \rar{q} & E \dar{p}
      \\ B \rar{g} & B' \rar{f} & B.
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Suppose we have $\phi \in \Aut(E'/B')$. We claim $\phi$ restricts
    via $\id_E \times h : E \to E'$ to an element of $\Aut(E/B)$. Let
    $(e,b') \in E'$. Suppose $b' = g(b)$. Then
    \[
    p(e) = f(b') = f(g(b)) = b \implies (e,b') = (e, h(e)),
    \]
    and hence $\im(\id_E \times h) = p'^{-1}(\im(g))$. It follows that
    $\phi(\im(\id_E \times h)) \subseteq \im(\id_E \times h)$.
    Moreover,
    \[
    pq\phi(\id_E \times h) = fp'\phi(\id_E \times h) = fp'(\id_E
    \times h) = fgp = p.
    \]
    Thus we get a morphism
    \[
    \alpha \colon \Aut(E'/B') \to \Aut(E/B), \quad \phi \mapsto
    q\phi(\id_E \times h).
    \]
    Conversely, we have a morphism
    \[
    \beta \colon \Aut(E/B) \to \Aut(E'/B'), \quad \psi \mapsto \psi
    \times \id_{B'}.
    \]
    We evidently have $\alpha\beta = \id$, so $\alpha$ is
    surjective. And $\alpha$ is injective since $p'$ is a covering by
    (1), and hence an element of $\Aut(E'/B')$ is determined uniquely
    by the image of any point. \qedhere
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

We apply Lemma \ref{cover-pullback} with $B \ce S^1 \vee S^1$
and $B'$ the connected sum of two tori. There are obvious projection
and inclusion maps $B \to B' \to B$ which exhibit $B$ as a retract of
$B'$. Now, there is an irregular cover $p : E \to B$ of degree
$3$. E.g., we can take the subcover of the Cayley graph of $S^3$
described in problem set $1$ corresponding to the non-normal subgroup
$\Z/2 \inj S^3$. Then by the lemma the pullback $p' : E' \to B'$ is an
irregular (unbranched) covering of degree $3$. Since $B'$ is a compact
Riemann surface, $E'$ automatically inherits a unique complex
structure such that $p'$ is holmorphic. This evidently contradicts the
converse.

\prob{5}

We know $p$ must have critical points at $0$, $1$, and $u > 1$, with
multiplicities $3$, $2$, and $2$ respectively. Therefore $p'(z) =
\lambda z^2(z-1)(z-u)$ for some $\lambda \in \C^*$, whence
\[
p(z) = \lambda\l( \frac{z^5}{5} - \frac{(u+1)z^4}{4} + \frac{uz^3}{3}
\r).
\]
Now we must have $p(u) = 0$ so we get
\[
0 = \lambda\l(\frac{u^5}{5} - \frac{u^5}{4} - \frac{u^4}{4} +
\frac{u^4}{3}\r) \implies u = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
Then the condition $p(1) = 1$ gives $\lambda = 45/4$, so finally
\[
p(z) = \frac{9z^5}{4} - \frac{15z^4}{2} + \frac{15z^3}{4}.
\]

\prob{6}

In last week's homework and in lecture we saw that the quotient $f : X
\to \P^1$ by rotation of the fundamental square of $X$ is a Beyli map.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{7}

Let $G$ be a finite group and $k \ce |G|$. Let $B$ be the wedge
sum of $k$ circles as illustrated below.
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pgfmathsetmacro{\w}{.4}
  \foreach \x in {-2, -1, 1, 2} {
    \draw (2 * \x * \w, 0) circle (\w);
  }
  \draw (0,0) node {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
Observe $B$ is a deformation retract of the $n$-times punctured plane,
so $\pi_1(B) \simeq F_k$. The tautological surjection $F_k \to G$
determines a regular covering $p : E \to B$ with $\Aut(E/B) \simeq
G$. Now, similar to problem 4, let $B'$ be the connected sum of $k$
tori so that there is an evident retraction $B \to B' \to B$. By Lemma
\ref{cover-pullback}, the pullback $p' : E' \to B'$ gives the desired
regular covering of compact Riemann surfaces.

Now consider $G \simeq (\Z/2)^n$. If $Y$ is a compact Riemann surface
of genus $k$, then $Y$ is homeomorphic to the connected sum of $k$
tori so
\[
\pi_1(Y) \simeq \langle a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_k, b_k \mid
a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1} \cdots a_kb_ka_kb_k^{-1}\rangle.
\]
There is a regular covering $X \to Y$ with $\Aut(X/Y) \simeq G$ if and
only if there is a surjection $\pi_1(Y) \to G$. Since $G$ is abelian,
this is equivalent to the requirement that there be a surjection of
$F_{2k} \to G$. Since $G$ is minimally generated by $n$ elements, the
minimal genus $k$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$.

\prob{8}

By a change of basis we without loss of generality assume $L = \{(x,y)
\in \C^2 \mid xy = 0\}$. Then $\C^2 - L = \C^* \times \C^*$. Since
$\pi_1(\C^*) \simeq \Z$ and $\pi_1$ preserves products we have
$\pi_1(\C^2 - L) \simeq \Z^2$. We define the two-sheeted covering $Y
\to \C^2$ branched over $L$ as follows. Let $Y^* \to \C^2 - L$ be the
unique (up to isomorphism) connected unbranched covering corresponding
to the surjection $\Z^2 \to \Z/2$ sending each generator to $1$. As a
set we define $Y \ce Y^* \amalg L$, and we give it the weakest
topology such that the obvious map $Y \to \C^2$ is continuous and
restricts to the covering $Y^* \to \C^2 - L$.

Let $Q \ce \{(x,y,z) \in \C^3 \mid z^2 = xy\}$ be the quadric. We
claim $Y$ and $Q$ are homeomorphic. Let $p : Q \to \C^2$ be the
projection $(x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y)$. It is clear that $p^{-1}(L) \simeq
L$ and letting $Q^* \ce Q - p^{-1}(L)$, the restriction $p \colon Q^*
\to \C^2 - L$ is a connected unbranched two-sheeted
covering. Moreover, since $Q$ is symmetric under the automorphism
$(x,y,z) \mapsto (y,x,z)$, this covering must correspond to a
surjection $\Z^2 \to \Z/2$ which is symmetric in the two
generators. Hence the only possibility is that each generator is sent
to $1$. Thus $Q^* \simeq Y^*$. So
\[
Q = Q^* \amalg p^{-1}(L) \simeq Y^* \amalg L = Y
\]
as sets, and it only remains to be shown that the topology on $Q$
induced from $\C^3$ is the weakest such the conditions stated above
are satisfied. But this follows from the evident fact that any open $U
\subseteq Q$ can be written as a union of opens in $Q^* \simeq Y^*$
(around points of $U \cap Q^*$) and opens of the form $p^{-1}(V)$ for
an open $V \subseteq \C^2$ (around points of $U \cap p^{-1}(L)$).

Now suppose $Q$ were homeomorphic to a manifold. Then as discussed in
section, the real points $Q(\R)$ would be a manifold, as the subspace
fixed under the conjugation involution of $\C^3$. But this is a
contradiction because $Q(\R) - \{(0,0,0)\}$ is clearly disconnected,
which cannot be since $Q(\R)$ could not be one-dimensional. x$x$
