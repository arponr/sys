\begin{lemma}
  \label{noetherian-minimal}
  Let $X$ be a noetherian topological space. Then any nonempty
  collection $\mathcal{Z}$ of closed sets of $X$ has a minimal element
  (with respect to inclusion).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  If not, we could produce a descending chain of closed sets $Z_1
  \supsetneq Z_2 \supsetneq Z_3 \supsetneq \cdots$ in $\mathcal{Z}$,
  contradicting that $X$ is noetherian.
\end{proof}

\noindent Suppose $X \simeq \Spec A$. Recall that for any open affine
$\Spec A'$ in a locally noetherian scheme we must have $A'$
noetherian. Thus $X$ noetherian implies $A$ noetherian. By Problem 2
below, then $X$ has a noetherian underlying topological space. Define
$\mathcal{Z}$ to be the collection of closed sets of $X$ which do not
consist of finitely many irreducible components. By Lemma
\ref{noetherian-minimal}, if $\mathcal{Z}$ were nonempty it would
contain a minimal closed set $Z \in \mathcal{Z}$. Obviously $Z$ cannot
be irreducible, so we can write $Z = Z_1 \cup Z_2$ a union of proper
closed subsets. But $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ consist of finitely many
irreducibly components by minimality of $Z$. Then clearly $Z$ does as
well, contradiction. Thus $\mathcal{Z}$ must be empty, implying $X$
consists of finitely many irreducible components. \win

\subsection*{Proof}

\renewcommand{\a}{\mathfrak{a}}

Let $A$ noetherian and $X \coloneqq \Spec A$. Let $Z_1 \supseteq Z_2
\supseteq Z_3 \supseteq \cdots$ a descending chain of closed sets of
$X$. For $i \in \N$, write $Z_i = V(\a_i)$ for an ideal $\a_i
\subseteq A$. Then $\a_1 \subseteq \a_2 \subseteq \a_2 \subseteq
\cdots$ is an ascending chain of ideals, so by noetherianness it
stabilises. But then the descending chain of closeds stabilises
too. Thus $X$ has a noetherian underlying topological space. \win

\subsection*{Counterexample}

The converse is false. Consider $A \coloneqq \Spec
k[t_1,t_2,\ldots]/(t_1^2,t_2^2,\ldots)$ for $k$ a field, say. Clearly
any non-unit in $A$ is nilpotent, and hence $\nil(A) =
(t_1,t_2,\ldots)$ is the only prime in $A$. Thus the underlying space
of $\Spec A$ is a single point, which is of course noetherian. But $A$
is not noetherian, witnessed by the ascending chain of ideals $(t_1)
\subsetneq (t_1,t_2) \subsetneq (t_1,t_2,t_3) \subsetneq \cdots$. \win

\prob{3}

\subsection*{Finitely generated}

Let $f \in A$ a uniformiser and $\m \coloneqq (f)$. Since the only
ideals in $A$ are of the form $(f^n)$ for $n \in \N$, we have $K
\simeq A_{(0)} \simeq A_f \simeq A[t]/(ft-1)$ is a finitely generated
$A$-algebra. And obviously $k \simeq A/\m$ is a finitely generated
$A$-algebra. It follows that $K \times k$ is a finitely generated
$A$-algebra. \win

\subsection*{Bijection}

In a previous problem set I proved $\Spec(A_1 \times A_2) \simeq \Spec
A_1 \amalg \Spec A_2$, the identification of sets in this context
being $\Spec(K \times k) = \{(0) \times k, K \times (0)\}$. Now, as a
set $\Spec A = \{(0), \m\}$, and so we get that $f$ is a bijection
from
\[
\phi^{-1}((0) \times k) = i^{-1}((0)) = (0) \quad\text{and}\quad
\phi^{-1}(K \times (0)) = \pi^{-1}((0)) = \m.
\]
\ \win

\subsection*{Dimension}

From the descriptions of $\Spec A$ and $\Spec(K \times k)$ given
above, it is clear that $\dim(Y) = \dim(A) = 1$ and $\dim(X) = \dim(K
\times k) = 0$. \win

\prob{4}

\subprob{a}

Let $A \coloneqq R[t]$. Following the hint, let $\pi \in R$ a
uniformiser and $\p \coloneqq (\pi t - 1) \subseteq A$. Since $A/\p
\simeq R_\pi \simeq R_{(0)}$ is a field, $\p$ is a closed point in $X
= \Spec A$. Now, since $\p$ is principal, we have by Krull's
Hauptidealsatz that $\dim(\O_{X,\p}) = \dim(A_\p) \le 1$. On the other
hand we must have $\dim(X) = \dim(A) = \dim(R) + 1 = 2$ since $R$ is a
DVR. Thus $\dim(X) \ne \dim(\O_{X,\p})$. \win

\subprob{b}

With $\p$ as in (a), we can consider $Y \coloneqq \{\p\}$. Then
clearly $\dim(Y) = 0$. But, as in (a), $\codim(Y,X) = \dim(A_\p) = 1
\ne 2 = \dim(X)$. \win

\subprob{c}

Let $\pi \in R \subset A$ as in (a). Consider the nonempty open $U
\coloneqq D(\pi) \subseteq X$. Then $U \simeq \Spec(A_\pi)$, and
$A_\pi \simeq R_\pi[t] \simeq K[t]$ where $K \coloneqq \Frac(R)$. Thus
$\dim(U) = \dim(K[t]) = 1$, but $\dim(X) = 2$ as in the previous
parts. \win

\subsection*{Condition $(*)$}

We show $X \times \P^1$ is still separated, noetherian, integral, and
regular in codimension $1$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Separated: By stability under base change, $X \times \P^1$ is
  separated over $\P^1$, but we know $\P^1$ is separated (in fact
  proper), so this implies $X \times \P^1$ is separated.
\item Noetherian: Since $X$ is noetherian it is a finite union of
  noetherian affine schemes. And of course $\P^1$ is covered by two
  copies of $\A^1$. It follows that $X \times \P^1$ has a finite cover
  of open affines of the form $\Spec(A) \times \A^1$ where $A$ is
  noetherian. But
  \[
  \Spec(A) \times \A^1 \simeq \Spec(A \otimes_\Z \Z[t]) \simeq
  \Spec(A[t])
  \]
  is noetherian as well. This implies $X \times \P^1$ is noetherian.
\item Integral: We show $X \times \P^1$ is reduced and irreducible. As
  above, $X \times \P^1$ is covered by open affines of the form
  $\Spec(A) \times \A^1 \simeq \Spec(A[t])$, where now we assume $A$
  is integral. It is clear that reducedness can be checked on an open
  cover, so this gives $X \times \P^1$ is reduced. For irreducibility,
  note that each of these opens is irreducible. Thus, as shown on a
  previous problem set, it suffices to show $X \times \P^1$ is
  connected. But I don't know how to show this?
\item Regular in codimension $1$: the condition is local, so it
  follows from the fact that $X \times \A^1$ is regular in
  codimension $1$, proven in Hartshorne. \win
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Class group}

Here's the argument I tried but failed to complete:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the open subscheme $U \coloneqq X \times \A^1 \subseteq
  X \times \P^1$. As mentioned in lecture, and proved in Hartshorne,
  we have $\Cl(U) \simeq \Cl(X)$.
\item Then $Z \coloneqq X - U = X \times \{\infty\}$ should be of
  codimension $1$.
\item This gives an exact sequence $\Z \to \Cl(X \times \P^1) \to
  \Cl(U) \simeq \Cl(X) \to 0$.
\item Then I just have to show that $\Z \to \Cl(X \times \P^1)$ is
  injective (i.e., no multiple of $X \times \{\infty\}$ is principal)
  and then that the exact sequence splits.
\end{enumerate}
