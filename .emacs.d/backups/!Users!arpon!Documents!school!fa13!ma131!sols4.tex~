  In problems 1 and 2, I will denote the origin in $\R^n$ by $0$.

\section{Topologist's sine curve}

Let $f : (0,1] \to \R^2$ given by $x \mapsto (x, \sin(1/x))$, and $g :
  [-1,1] \to \R^2$ given by $y \mapsto (0, y)$. Then the topologist's
  sine curve is by definition $S := \im(f) \amalg \im(g)$. Assume $S =
  U \amalg V$ is a decomposition of $S$ into open sets of $S$.

  Since $g$ is continuous and $[-1,1]$ is connected, $\im(g)$ is
  connected, whence $\im(g) \subseteq U$ without loss of
  generality. Then by definition of the induced topology on $S$, $U =
  U_0 \cap S$ for some $U_0$ open in $\R^2$ containing $\im(g)$. Note
  $0 \in \im(g)$. So by definition of the topology on $\R^2$, $U_0
  \supseteq B(0,r)$ for some $r > 0$. Now choose $k \in \N$ such that
  $1/(k\pi) < r$, so that $p := (1/(k\pi), 0) \in U_0$. Then since
  $\sin(k\pi) = 0$ it follows that $p \in \im(f) \cap U$.

  Finally, since $f$ is continuous and $(0,1]$ is connected, we must
    have $\im(f) \subseteq U$. But then $U = S$, so $V = \emptyset$,
    and thus $S$ is connected.

\section{One-point compactification of $\R^n$}

\subsection{Hausdorffness}

Let $x,y \in X$. If $x,y \in \R^n$ then we can find disjoint open
neighbourhoods by the Hausdorffness of $\R^n$. So we can take $x \in
\R^n$ and $y = \infty$ without loss of generality. Let $r := |x|$;
then $V := B(0,2r)$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$, disjoint from the
open neighbourhood $U_{2r}$ of $\infty$.

\newcommand{\V}{\mathcal{V}}

\subsection{Compactness}

Let $\V$ an open cover of $X$. Then there exists $V_\infty \in \V$
containing $\infty$. By definition of the topology on $X$, $V_\infty
\supseteq U_r$ for some $r > 0$. Now $\V$ a fortiori is an open cover
of $X - U_r = \oline{B(0,r)}$. But since $\oline{B(0,r)}$ is closed
and bounded in $\R^n$, it must be compact, and hence there is a finite
subcollection $\V' \subseteq \V$ covering $X - U_r$. Then clearly $\V'
\cup \{V_\infty\}$ is a finite subcollection of $\V$ covering
$X$. Thus $X$ is compact.

\begin{remark}
  A number of people said that we must have $U_r \in \V$ for some $r >
  0$ since ``these are the only opens containing $\infty$''. Be
  careful about the distinction between a basis and the whole topology
  though!
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  One should also note that the subspace topology of $\R^n \subseteq
  X$ is equivalent to the standard topology, simply because $U_r \cap
  \R^n$ is open in the standard topology for all $r > 0$. But this is
  pretty obvious so I didn't require this to be said explicitly.
\end{remark}

\section{The sup metric on bounded sequences}

\subsection{Metric axioms}

Let $a,b,c \in X$. First note that since $a,b$ are bounded, the
triangle inequality for absolute value gives that $(|a_i - b_i|)$ is
bounded, and hence $d(a,b) = \sup |a_i - b_i| \in \R$ is well defined.
Next, by definition of $\sup$ and nonnegativity of absolute value,
\[
d(a,b) = 0 \iff |a_i - b_i| = 0\text{ for all }i \in \N \iff a = b.
\]
And $|a_i - b_i| = |b_i - a_i| \implies d(a,b) = d(b,a)$. Finally by
the triangle inequality for absolute value and properties of $\sup$,
\begin{align*}
&|a_i - c_i| \le |a_i - b_i| + |b_i - c_i|\text{ for all }i \in \N
  \\ \implies &\sup |a_i - c_i| \le \sup (|a_i - b_i| + |b_i - c_i|)
  \le \sup |a_i - b_i| + \sup |b_i - c_i| \\ \implies &d(a,c) \le
  d(a,b) + d(b,c).
\end{align*}
Thus $d$ is a metric on $X$.

\subsection{Completeness}

Let $(a^{(j)}) \in X^\N$ a Cauchy sequence. Then for each $\epsilon >
0$ there exists $n \in \N$ such that $d(a^{(j)},a^{(k)}) < \epsilon$
for all $j,k \ge n$. By definition of $d$, this in particular implies
that for each $i \in \N$ that $|a^{(j)}_i - a^{(k)}_i| < \epsilon$ for
$j,k \ge n$, and hence $(a^{(j)}_i)$ is Cauchy for fixed $i$. But $\R$
is complete, so we can define $a \in \R^\N$ by $a_i := \lim a^{(j)}_i$
for $i \in \N$.

Note then that for all $i \in \N$,
\[
|a^{(j)}_i - a^{(k)}_i| < \epsilon\text{ for all }j,k \ge n \implies
|a_i - a^{(j)}_i| \le \epsilon\text{ for all }j \ge n.
\]
Firstly, since $a^{(n)}$ is bounded, this implies that $a$ is bounded,
so $a \in X$. Secondly, this implies that $d(a, a^{(j)}) \le \epsilon$
for $j \ge n$, whence we have $a = \lim a^{(j)}$ by definition. Thus
$X$ is complete.

\begin{remark}
  Many people just stated without proof that the termwise limit must
  be the limit, i.e., that $a = \lim a^{(j)}$. This is certainly not
  clear---you \textit{must} use the Cauchy condition on $(a^{(j)})$
  again.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Closure of $B$}

We claim $\oline B = \{a \in X \mid \lim a_i = 0\}$. Let $a \in
X$. Then $a \in \oline B$ if and only if $B_d(a,\epsilon) \cap B \ne
\emptyset$ for each $\epsilon > 0$.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $a \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then $B_d(a,\epsilon) \cap B \ne
  \emptyset$ if and only if there exists $n \in \N$ such that $|a_i| <
  \epsilon$ for $i \ge n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  $(\Rightarrow)$ Assume $b \in B_d(a,\epsilon) \cap B$. By definition
  of $B$ there exists $n \in \N$ such that $b_i = 0$ for $i \ge
  n$. Then
  \[
  b \in B_d(a,\epsilon) \implies d(a,b) < \epsilon \implies |a_i -
  b_i| < \epsilon\text{ for }i \in \N \implies |a_i| < \epsilon\text{
    for }i \ge n.
  \]

  $(\Leftarrow)$ Assume $|a_i| < \epsilon$ for $i \ge n$. Then if we
  define $b \in X$ by $b_i := a_i$ for $i < n$ and $b_i = 0$ for $i
  \ge n$, clearly $d(a,b) < \epsilon$ and $b \in B$.
\end{proof}

By the lemma, $a \in \oline B$ if and only if for each $\epsilon > 0$
there exists $n \in \N$ such that $|a_i| < \epsilon$ for $i \ge
n$. But of course this is equivalent to the condition that $\lim a_i =
0$.

\section{(Compact) Banach fixed point theorem}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $(Y,d)$ a metric space. Then $d : Y \times Y \to \R$ is
  continuous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show $d^{-1}(I)$ is open in $Y$ for any open interval
  $I = (a,b)$ in $\R$. Let $(x,y) \in d^{-1}(I)$, so $a < d(x,y) <
  b$. Let
  \[
  \textstyle{r := \frac 12 \min(d(x,y) - a, b - d(x,y)).}
  \]
  Then for any $(x',y') \in B_d(x,r) \times B_d(y,r)$ we have by the
  triangle inequality that
  \begin{align*}
  d(x',y') &\le d(x,y) + d(x',x) + d(y,y') > d(x,y) + 2r \le
  b,\\ d(x',y') &\ge d(x,y) - d(x',x) - d(y,y') > d(x,y) - 2r \ge a.
  \end{align*}
  Thus $a < d(x',y') < b \implies (x',y') \in d^{-1}(I)$, and it
  follows that $d^{-1}(I)$ is open.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  In the above proof I started with ``It suffices'' and ended with
  ``it follows that''. Make sure you understand why I could say these
  things (or ask me why if you're not completely sure)!
\end{remark}

\subsection{Existence of fixed point}

The map $X \to X \times X$ sending $x \mapsto (x, f(x))$ is continuous
since the identity $\id_X$ and $f$ are both continuous\footnote{Recall
  this is the ``universal property'' of the product topology (or
  Munkres, Theorem 18.4).}. By the lemma, $d$ is continuous, so then
the composition $\phi : X \to \R$ defined by $\phi(x) := d(x,f(x))$ is
continuous. Since $X$ is compact, $\phi$ must achieve it's minimum at
some point $x \in X$. If $x \ne f(x)$ then by hypothesis
\[
\phi(f(x)) = d(f(x), f(f(x))) < d(x, f(x)) = \phi(x),
\]
a contradiction, so we must have $f(x) = x$.

\subsection{Uniqueness of fixed point}

Let $x,y \in X$ such that $f(x) = x$ and $f(y) = y$. If $x \ne y$ then
we have by hypothesis
\[
d(x,y) = d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y),
\]
a contradiction.

\section{Munkres \S 3.24, Exercise 1}

\subsection*{(a)}

Suppose we have a homeomorphism $f : [0,1] \to (0,1)$. It is easy to
see that restriction induces a homeomorphism $[0, 1) \simeq (0,1) -
  \{f(1)\}$. But $(0,1]$ is connected and
\[
(0,1) - \{f(1)\} = (0, f(1)) \amalg (f(2), 1)
\]
is clearly disconnected, a contradiction since the continuous image of
a connected space is connected. The same argument shows that $(0,1]
  \not\simeq (0,1)$.

Finally, suppose we have a homeomorphism $g : [0, 1] \to (0,
1]$. Again, restriction induces a homeomorphism $(0, 1] \to (0, 1] -
      \{g(0)\}$. If $g(0) = 1$ this contradiction that $(0, 1]
        \not\simeq (0, 1)$, as shown above. And if $g(0) \ne 1$ the
        same connectedness argument used above gives a contradiction.

\subsection*{(b)}

Clearly we have embeddings $[0, 1] \simeq [1/3, 2/3] \subset (0, 1)$
and $(0, 1) \subset [0, 1]$, but we showed in (a) that $[0, 1]
\not\simeq (0, 1)$.

\subsection*{(c)}

Suppose we have a homeomorphism $f : \R \to \R^n$ with $n >
1$. Restriction induces a homeomorphism $\R - \{0\} \simeq \R^n -
\{f(0)\}$. But $\R - \{0\} = (-\infty, 0) \amalg (0, \infty)$ is
disconnected and clearly $\R^n - \{f(0)\}$ is (path-)connected, a
contradiction.

\begin{remark}
  This problem illustrates how to use connectedness as a way to
  distinguish between topological spaces (up to homeomorphism). But
  still, it might seem sort of dumb to you that we had to define all
  this stuff just to show $\R \not\simeq \R^n$ for $n > 1$! Shouldn't
  this be obvious? Well, let's put it this way: try to prove $\R^n
  \not\simeq \R^m$ when $n \ne m$. (Or maybe just think about it for a
  second, because it's actually hard! The point is that we need some
  higher powered ``invariants'' of topological spaces to distinguish
  between $\R^n$ and $\R^m$. And we need invariants and topological
  properties because, as you may have guessed, it's hard to just sit
  down and prove explicitly, ``it's impossible to write down a
  homeomorphism between these two spaces''.)
\end{remark}

\section{Munkres \S 3.24, Exercise 2}

If $f(1) = f(-1)$ we're done, so assume without loss of generality
that $f(1) > f(-1)$. Consider $g : S^1 \to \R$ defined by $g(x) :=
f(x) - f(-x)$, which is continuous because addition, negation, and $f$
are continuous. By hypothesis $g(1) > 0$ and $g(-1) < 0$. Then since
$S^1$ is connected (Munkres \S 24, Example 5), by the intermediate
value theorem (Munkres, Theorem 24.3) there exists $x \in S^1$ such
that
\[
g(x) = 0 \implies f(x) = f(-x).
\]

\section{Munkres \S 3.24, Exercise 9}

\begin{remark}
  As you will see, this is not a \textit{completely} rigorous write-up
  of the solution, and I didn't expect one, since the idea is clear
  and writing this up rigorously doesn't seem particularly appealing
  or useful.
\end{remark}

Let $x, y \in \R^2 - A$ any two distinct points. The sets of lines
$L_x \subset \R^2$ containing $x$ and $L_y \subset \R^2$ containing
$y$ are each parameterised by their slope $s \in \R$, and hence there
are uncountably many of each. As $A$ is only countable, and since a
line is uniquely determined by any two distinct points on it, there
are then uncountably many (since the union of two countable sets is
countable!) lines $L_x$ through $x$ and $L_y$ through $y$ which don't
intersect $A$. But then clearly one pair of $L_x$ and $L_y$ must
intersect, which determines a path in $\R^2 - A$ from $x$ to $y$.

\section{Munkres \S 3.26, Exercise 5}

\begin{lemma}
  For $a \in A$, there exists an open neighbourhood $U_a$ of $a$
  disjoint from an open set $V_a$ containing $B$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $a \in A$. For $b \in B$ we can choose disjoint open
  neighbourhoods $U_b$ of $a$ and $V_b$ of $b$ because $X$ is
  Hausdorff and $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Clearly $\{V_b\}_{b \in B}$
  is an open cover of $B$, so since $B$ is compact there exist $b_1,
  \ldots, b_n \in B$ such that $V_a := \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_{b_i}$
  contains $B$. Then $U_a := \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_{b_i}$ is an open
  neighbourhood of $a$, disjoint from each $V_{b_i}$, and hence
  disjoint from $V_a$.
\end{proof}

Let $U_a, V_a$ as in the lemma for each $a \in A$. Then $\{U_a\}_{a
  \in A}$ is an open cover of $A$, so by compactness there exist $a_1,
\ldots, a_n \in A$ such that $U := \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_{a_i}$ contains
$A$. Then $\bigcap_{i=1}^n V_{a_i}$ is an open set containing $B$,
disjoint from each $U_{a_i}$, and hence disjoint from $U$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Munkres \S 3.26, Exercise 8}

$(\Rightarrow)$ Assume $f$ is continuous. Let $(x,y) \in X \times Y -
G_f$, so $y \ne f(x)$. Since $Y$ is Hausdorff we can choose disjoint
open neighbourhoods $U$ of $y$ and $V$ of $f(x)$. By continuity,
$f^{-1}(V)$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$. Then $f^{-1}(V) \times U$
is an open neighbourhood of $(x,y)$ which cannot intersect $G_f$ since
$U$ and $V$ are disjoint. Thus $X \times Y - G_f$ is open, whence
$G_f$ is closed.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Assume $G_f$ is closed. To show $f$ is continuous it
suffices to show $f^{-1}(A)$ is closed in $X$ for $A$ closed in
$Y$. So let $A$ closed in $Y$. Then $X \times Y - X \times A = X
\times (Y - A)$ is open, so $X \times A$ is closed. Thus $X \times A
\cap G_f$ is closed. Finally, clearly $f^{-1}(A) = \pi(X \times A)$,
where $\pi$ denotes the first projection, so we're done by the
following lemma.

\begin{lemma}[Exercise 7]
  Let $Y$ a compact space and $X$ any space. Then the first projection
  $\pi : X \times Y \to X$ is a closed map.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A \subseteq X \times Y$ closed. Let $x \in X - \pi(A)$, so that
  $x \times Y \subseteq X \times Y - A$. Then the tube lemma (see
  Munkres, Theorem 26.7, Step 1) implies that there is an open
  neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U \times Y \subseteq X \times Y
  - A$. I.e., $U \subseteq X - \pi(A)$. Thus $X - \pi(A)$ is open, so
  $\pi(A)$ is closed, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Note that we only needed the Hausdorff hypothesis for one direction,
  and only the compactness hypothesis for the other direction.
\end{remark}
