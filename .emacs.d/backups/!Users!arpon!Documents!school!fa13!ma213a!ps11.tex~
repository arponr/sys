\prob{1}

\subprob{a}

Let $f \in C(\R/2\pi\Z)$. Let $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$. Let $\epsilon >
0$. By continuity of $f$, choose $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(\theta) -
f(\theta-\phi) | < \epsilon$ when $|\phi| < \delta$. By axiom (iii) of
an approximate identity, choose $r_0 \in [0,1]$ such that $|h_r(\phi)|
< \epsilon$ when $r \ge r_0$ and $|\phi| \ge \delta$. Then we have by
axiom (ii) that
\begin{align*}
  \left| f(\theta) - \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}
  h_r(\phi)f(\theta-\phi) \,d\phi \right| &= \left|
  \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} h_r(\phi)(f(\theta)-f(\theta-\phi))
  \,d\phi \right| \\ &\le \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}
  |h_r(\phi)||f(\theta)-f(\theta-\phi)| \,d\phi.
\end{align*}
By axioms (i) and (ii) and the choice of $\delta$ we have
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^\delta |h_r(\phi)||f(\theta)-f(\theta-\phi)|
\,d\phi \le \frac{\delta}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} h_r(\phi)\,d\phi =
\frac{\delta}{2\pi}
\]
Now let $M \coloneqq \sup_{\phi \in \R/2\pi z} |f(\phi)|$, which is
finite by compactness and continuity. Then for $r \ge r_0$, by choice
of $r_0$ we have
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\delta^{2\pi} |h_r(\phi)||f(\theta)-f(\theta-\phi)|
\,d\phi \le 2\epsilon M.
\]
The above two inequalities prove that
\[
\left| f(\theta) - \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} h_r(\phi)f(\theta-\phi)
\,d\phi \right| \to 0
\]
as $r \to 1$, as desired. Note too that the choice of $r_0$ and both
bounds are independent of $\theta$ (since $f$ must be
\textit{uniformly} continuous on the compact space $\R/2\pi\Z \simeq
S^1$), and hence the convergence is uniform in $\theta$. \win

\subprob{b}

First, observe that
\[
1 + r^2 - 2r\cos(\theta) = (1 - re^{i\theta})(1 - re^{-i\theta}) = |1
- re^{i\theta}|^2.
\]
It follows that the numerator and denominator of $P_r(\theta)$ are
nonnegative for all $r, \theta$, giving axiom (i). Suppose we are
given $\delta > 0$. Then
\[
1 - r^2 \to 0 \quad\text{and}\quad |1 - re^{i\theta}|^2 \to |1 -
e^{i\theta}|^2 \ge |1 - e^{i\delta}|^2 > 0
\]
as $r \to 1$ for all $|\theta| \ge \delta$, which clearly implies
axiom (iii). Finally the identity
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1 - r^2}{1 + r^2 - 2r\cos(\theta)}
\,d\theta = 1
\]
for $r \in (0,1)$ is immediate from Poisson's formula for the harmonic
(constant) function $u \coloneqq 1$, giving axiom (ii). \win

\subprob{c}

First observe convolution is commutative: by a change of variables
$\phi \mapsto \theta-\phi$ and periodicity, for all $r,\theta$ we have
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta-\phi)P_r(\phi)\,d\phi =
\int_{\theta-2\pi}^{\theta} f(\phi)\,P_r(\theta-\phi)\,d\phi =
\int_0^{2\pi} f(\phi)P_r(\theta-\phi) d\phi.
\]
Then evidently $P_r(\theta)$ is $C^1$ on $\Delta$, so by commuting
differentiation and integration, to show $u$ is harmonic on $\Delta$
it suffices to show $P_r(\theta)$ is harmonic on $\Delta$. But writing
\[
\frac{1 - r^2}{1 + r^2 - 2r\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1 - x^2 - y^2}{1 +
  x^2 + y^2 - 2x},
\]
this follows simply by expanding the quantity $\del^2/\del x^2 +
\del^2/\del y^2$, which I'll omit here for concision.

Now, to finish it suffices to show that if we set $u(e^{i\theta})
\coloneqq f(\theta)$ for $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$, then $u$ is continuous
on $\oline\Delta$. Fix $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$ and let $\epsilon >
0$. By continuity of $f$ we can choose $\delta > 0$ such that
$|f(\phi) - f(\theta)| < \epsilon/2$ for $|\phi-\theta| < \delta$. By
(a), in particular the remark about uniformity, and (b) we can choose
$r_0 \in (0,1)$ such that $|u(re^{i\phi}) - f(\phi)| < \epsilon/2$ for
$r \ge r_0$ and $\phi \in [0,2\pi]$. It follows that on the open set
\[
\{z = re^{i\phi} \in \oline\Delta \mid r > r_0, |\phi - \theta| <
\delta\},
\]
we have, by the triangle inequality,
\[
|u(z) - u(e^{i\theta})| = |u(re^{i\phi} - f(\theta)| \le
|u(re^{i\phi}) - f(\phi)| + |f(\phi) - f(\theta)| < \epsilon.
\]
Thus, the extension of $u$ is indeed continuous on
$\oline\Delta$. \win

\subprob{d}

Recall that the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of convolution of functions
is just the product of the $n$-th Fourier coefficients of the
functions. Thus it suffices to show that for $r \in (0,1)$ the $n$-th
Fourier coefficient of $P_r(\theta)$ is $r^{|n|}$ for $n \in \Z$. To
do this, recall from the previous problem set that
\[
P_r(\theta) = \frac{1-r^2}{1+r^2-2r\cos(\theta)} = \Re\left(
\frac{1+re^{i\theta}}{1-re^{i\theta}} \right) = \Re\left(
\frac{1}{1-re^{i\theta}} \right) + \Re\left(
\frac{re^{i\theta}}{1-re^{i\theta}} \right).
\]
Now, $(1 - re^{i\theta})^{-1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^ne^{in\theta}$. It
follows that
\begin{align*}
  2 \Re\left( \frac{1}{1-re^{i\theta}} \right) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty
  r^ne^{in\theta} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^ne^{-in\theta} = 1 + \sum_{n
    \in \Z} r^{|n|} e^{in\theta}, \\ 2 \Re\left(
  \frac{re^{i\theta}}{1-re^{i\theta}} \right) &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty
  r^ne^{in\theta} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty r^ne^{-in\theta} = -1 + \sum_{n
    \in \Z} r^{|n|} e^{in\theta}.
\end{align*}
From this we get immediately that $P_r(\theta) = \sum_{n \in \Z}
r^{|n|} e^{in\theta}$, which implies the desired result. \win

\prob{2}

\renewcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}

Let $z \in U$ and $r > 0$ such that $\oline\Delta(z,r) \subseteq
U$. Then Cauchy's integral formula implies for any $f \in \F$ that
\begin{equation}
  \label{estimate} \tag{$\dagger$}
  |f(z)|^2 = |f^2(z)| = \left| \int_{\oline\Delta(z,r)}
  \frac{f^2(\zeta)}{\zeta - z}\,d\zeta \right| \le \left|
  \int_0^{2\pi} f^2(\zeta) \cdot i\, d\theta \right| \le \int_0^{2\pi}
  |f(\zeta)|^2 \,d\theta.
\end{equation}
By the theorem in lecture it suffices to show $\F$ is uniformly
bounded on compact sets $K \subseteq U$. By compactness we can cover
any such $K$ by finitely many open disks $D$ such that the disk $D'$
with equal centre but doubled radius still lies in $U$. Thus, it
suffices to show $\F$ is uniformly bounded on such a disk $D \subseteq
\oline D' \subseteq U$ of radius $R_0$. Let $z \in D$. Since $D'
\subseteq U$ we can choose $R \ge R_0$ such that $\oline\Delta(z,R)
\subseteq U$. Then we have by our hypothesis and the estimate
$(\dagger)$ that
\begin{align*}
C(D') &\ge \int_{D'} |f(\zeta)|^2\,dx\,dy \ge \int_{\oline\Delta(z,r)}
|f(\zeta)|^2\,dx\,dy = \int_0^R r \int_0^{2\pi}
|f(\zeta)|^2\,d\theta\,dr \\ &\ge |f(z)|^2 \int_0^R r\,dr =
\frac{|f(z)|^2 R^2}2 \ge \frac{|f(z)|^2 R_0^2}2
\end{align*}
for any $f \in \F$. It follows that $\F$ is uniformly bounded on $D$,
so we win. \win
