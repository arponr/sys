          mattered<br> &mdash; A. Grothendieck

        <p>Hi. I want to understand (certain) things. Writing notes
          seems like the best way for me to attempt to do that. This
          is a place for me to keep these attempts.</p>

        <p>These days I'm an undergraduate at Harvard, for the most
          part trying to understand (parts of) math. So most of my
          notes will be about that. But I'm also interested in
          computer science (when there's enough math&hellip;), and I'm
          nearly always distracted by music, fiction, design, tennis,
          and running. So maybe there will be some random notes about
          those things, too.</p>

        <p>If you are actually reading this and want to contact me,
          that's crazy, but you can email me at
          arpon.raksit@gmail.com</p>
