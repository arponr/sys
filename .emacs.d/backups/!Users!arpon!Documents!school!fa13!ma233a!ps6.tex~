\prob{1}

Since $Y$ is separated, the graph morphism $\Gamma_f : X \to X
\times_S Y$ is a closed immersion. And since $X$ is proper, hence
universally closed, the projection $\pi : X \times_S Y \to Y$ is a
closed map on spaces. It follows that $f = \pi \circ \Gamma_f$ has
closed image in $Y$. But by hypothesis $f$ also has open image, so $f$
must be surjective (on spaces) by connectednes of $Y$. Of course a
surjective open immersion is an isomorphism.
