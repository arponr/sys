\prob{2}

Any $f \in \Aut(X)$ determines a linear automorphism $f^* \in
\GL(\Omega(X))$, defined by $f^*(\omega) \ce \omega \circ f$. Choosing
a basis $\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_g\}$ of $\Omega(X)$ determines an
isomorphism $\Omega(X) \simeq \C^g$, which then gives an isomorphism
$i \c \GL(\Omega(X)) \simeq \GL_g(\C)$. Let $j \c \GL_g(\C) \to
\PGL_g(\C) \simeq \Aut(\P^{g-1})$ be the quotient map. We then have a
map
\[
\rho \c \Aut(X) \to \Aut(\P^{g-1}), \quad f \mapsto j(i(f^*)).
\]
Since the canonical map is defined by $\phi(x) \ce [\omega_1(x) :
\cdots : \omega_g(x)]$, we evidently have $\phi \circ f =
\rho(f) \circ \phi$ for $f \in \Aut(X)$.

\prob{3}

\subprob{i}

Let $f \in \Aut(\P^2) \simeq \PGL_3(\C)$ be an involution, and let $F
\in \GL_3(\C)$ be a representative of $f$. Since $f$ has order $2$ we
must have $F^2 = \lambda \cdot \id$ for some $\lambda \in \C^*$. This
implies $F$ is diagonalisable with possible eigenvalues
$\{\lambda^{1/2}, -\lambda^{1/2}\}$. Thus, one eigenspace of $F$ must
have dimension at least $2$. Since $f$ clearly fixes the
projectivisations of the eigenspaces of $F$, this implies $f$ fixes a
line in $\P^2$.

\subprob{ii}

Let $X$ be a non-hyperelliptic Riemann surface of genus $3$. Recall
from lecture this implies the canonical map $\phi \c X \to \P^2$ is an
embedding. Let $f \in \Aut(X)$ be an involution. Let $\rho \c \Aut(X)
\to \Aut(\P^2)$ be the representation constructed in Problem 2. Then
$\rho(f)^2 = \rho(f^2) = \rho(\id_\C) = \id_{\P^2}$ so $\rho(f)$ is an
involution on $\P^2$. By (i), this implies $\rho(f)$ fixes a line $L
\subset \P^2$. Since $\phi \circ f = \rho(f) \circ \phi$ and $\phi$ is
an embedding, to show $f$ has a fixed point it suffices to show
$\phi(X) \cap L \ne \emptyset$.

To do so, we use Problem 1. Note that if $\phi(X)$ were contained in a
line, then we would in fact have an embedding $\phi \c X \to
\P^1$. Since $\phi$ is holomorphic this would have to be an
isomorphism, contradicting that $X$ has genus $3$. Thus $\phi(X)$ is
an algebraic variety (of codimension $1$) in $\P^2$. It is a basic
fact in geometry that this implies $\phi(X) \cap L \ne
\emptyset$. (Otherwise $\phi(X)$ would be a projective subvariety of
the affine space $\P^2 - L$, so would have to be a point,
contradiction.)

\subprob{iii}

Consider the hyperelliptic Riemann surface $X$ defined by $y^2 = x^8 -
1$. There is an involution $f \in \Aut(X)$ induced by the map $(x,y)
\mapsto (-x,-y)$. Certainly no point on $X$ corresponding to a pair
$(x,y)$ is fixed by $f$, so if $f$ has fixed points then it must fix
the two points $p,q$ at infinity. Suppose this is the case. Let $G \ce
\Z/2$ act on $X$ by the identity and $f$, and let $Y \ce X/G$. Then
the quotient $X \to Y$ is a degree $2$ covering of Riemann surfaces
ramified precisely at $p,q$. By constancy of degree $p,q$ have
multiplicity $2$. So if $Y$ has genus $g$ then Riemann-Hurwitz tells
us that
\[
2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 2(2 - 2g) - 2 \implies 4g = 6,
\]
a contradiction since $g \in \Z$. So indeed $f$ has no fixed points.

\subprob{iv}

We proceed similarly to (iii). Suppose $X$ is a Riemann surface of
even genus $g$ and $f \in \Aut(X)$ is an involution without fixed
points. Then the action of $G \ce \Z/2$ on $X$ via $f$ defines an
\emph{unramified} degree $2$ covering of Riemann surfaces $X \to Y \ce
X/G$. If $Y$ has genus $h$ then we have
\[
2 - 2g = 2(2 - 2h) \implies 4h = 2(1+g),
\]
a contradiction since $1+g$ is odd and $h \in \Z$.
