# Big Q.

Fiction can change values because of emotion. Wallace has complicated philosophical thoughts but is trying to make them compelling and therefore convincing. What he means when in interviews he says he's reducing things is he's reducing the emotions in them.

## Cliches

Like reducing real things to the cliched language.

'So then at forty-six years of age I came here to learn to live by cliches,' is what Day says to Charlotte Treat right after Randy Lenz asked what time it was, again, at 0825. 'To turn my will and life over to the care of cliches. One day at a time. Easy does it. First things first. Courage is fear that has said its prayers. Ask for help. Thy will not mine be done. It works if you work it. Grow or go. Keep coming back.' [IJ 270]

## Jarring / realism

one needs to experience things in a real way and the weird thing is that pure realism isn't necessarily the way to do that. Jar the reader awake / away from default setting is maybe his most general project. he jars by breaking rules (hyperrealism (p.k.), octet). making the familiar strange.

You are, unfortunately, a fiction writer. [b.i. 145]

it's going to make you look fundamentally lost and confused and frightened and unsure about whether to trust even your most fundamental intuiitions about urgency and sameness and whether other people deep inside experience things in anything like the same way you do [b.i. 160]

## JOI

doesn't want to just say anything though. quest to stop playing games with reader, instead connect to them. (reflected in joi's filmography, wish for entertainment).

Games hadn't done it, professionals hadn't done it, impersonation of proffesionals hadn't done it. His last resort: entertainment. Make something so bloody compelling it would reverse thrust on a young self's fall into the womb of solipsism, anhedonia, death in life. A magically entertaining toy to dangle at the infant still somewhere alive in the boy, to make its eyes light and toothless mouth open unconiously, to laugh. TO bring him 'out of himself,' as they say. The womb could be used both ways. A way to say I AM SO VERY, VERY SORRY and have it *heartd*. A life-long dream. The scholars and Foundations and disseminators never saw that his most serious wish was: *to entertain*. [IJ 839]

# Small Q. 1

Pale King is an elaboration on the solution to some of the problems introduced in Infinite Jest. Makes it maybe more practical, real. Faith --> boredom.

# Small Q. 3

Making the reader work in order to really feel the ideas he's trying to get across. But work in different ways: parse the crazy shit (girl w/ cur, b.i.) vs connect/remember lots of info (ij) vs get through boredom (pale king)

# Small Q. 4

Wallace very worried about freedom and choice, something intrinsic to american culture.

supposedly fun thing
