\prob{1}

Recall from lecture that we have an exact sequence $0 \to \O \to \E^0
\to \E^{0,1} \to 0$. Since $\E^0, \E^{0,1}$ are $C^\infty$-modules
their higher cohomology vanishes. By the long exact sequence this
implies $\H^i(X,\O) \simeq 0$ for $i \ge 2$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{2}

If $f \in \M(U)$ then $df = 0$ if and only if $f$ is locally
constant. I.e., $0 \to \C \to \M \to \Q$ is exact, so it just remains
to show $d \c \M \to \Q$ is surjective. Let $p \in X$ and consider any
open neighbourhood $U \ni p$ with $(U,p) \simeq (\Delta,0)$. Let
$\omega \in \Q(U)$ and let $A \subseteq U$ be the set of poles of
$\omega$. Fix any $q_0 \in U - A$. For any $q \in U - A$ let $\gamma$
be a path from $q_0$ to $q$ and define
\[
f(q) \ce \int_\gamma \omega.
\]
This is independent of $\gamma$ because for any other choice $\eta$ we
have
\[
\int_\gamma \omega - \int_\eta \omega = \int_{\gamma - \eta} \omega =
c\sum_{x \in \operatorname{int}(\gamma - \eta)} \Res(x,\omega) = 0
\]
by definition of $\Q$. It's clear from path-independence that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is holomorphic on $U - A$ with $df = \omega$ from the
  fundamental theorem of calculus;
\item $\lim_{q \to a} f(q) = \infty$ for any $a \in A$, so $f \in
  \M(U)$.
\end{itemize}
It follows that $d\c \M \to \Q$ is surjective, as desired.

Now the exact sequence $0 \to \C \to \M \to \Q \to 0$ gives rise to a
long exact sequence
\[
0 \to \C \to \M(X) \to \Q(X) \to \H^1(X,\C) \to \H^1(X,\M) \to \cdots.
\]
Thus $\H^1(X,\M) \simeq 0$ implies $\Q(X) \to \H^1(X,\C)$ is
surjective. We claim this last map is just the period map.

\prob{5}

\newcommand{\cH}{\mathcal{H}}

By definition we have $\cH = \ker(\del\oline\del \c \E^0 \to \E^2)$,
so $0 \to \cH \to \E^0 \to \E^2$ is exact. Then the surjectivity of
$\del\oline\del$ follows immediately from what we did in lecture for
$\oline\del$ (in particular this is Corollary 7.3 on p. 65 of the
course notes).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{7}

From Problem 5 we get a long exact sequence
\[
0 \to \cH(X) \to \E^0(X) \to \E^2(X) \to \H^1(X,\cH) \to \H^1(X,\E^0)
\to \cdots.
\]
We know $\H^1(X,\E^0) \simeq 0$ so we must have $\H^1(X,\cH) \simeq
\E^2(X)/\oline\del\del\E^0(X)$. By Problem 6 we have
\[
\oline\del\E^{1,0}(X) = \oline\del\Omega(X) \oplus
\oline\del\del\E^0(X) = \oline\del\del\E^0(X)
\]
by definition of $\Omega(X)$. Therefore
\[
\H^1(X,\cH) \simeq \E^2(X)/\oline\del\E^{1,0}(X) \simeq \H^{1,1}(X).
\]
