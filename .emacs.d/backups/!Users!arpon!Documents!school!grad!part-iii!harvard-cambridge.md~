For most of high school I was banging away at keyboards, convinced
that programming was my vocation. I certainly liked math, but at the
time it was just a hobby, a social activity. For instance, the
American Mathematics Contest was for me simply a fun day during which
I realized "math is hard", not something I ever wanted or even thought
to train for. But my time at Harvard has radically shifted my
perspective on mathematics: in place of the haphazard set of
computations and problem-solving techniques I saw before college, I
now see a language that reveals fundamental structures through
abstraction, and can express fascinating stories about these
structures. This has in turn completely transformed my relationship
with mathematics: over the past three years I have chosen to invest a
basically absurd portion of my time in understanding and teaching
mathematics, and I plan on sustaining this absurdity for the remainder
of my conscious hours.

Though it took longer to discover my love of mathematics, I have
thrived in curiosity-driven settings since my early high school
years. From 2009--2011 I worked with Prof. Dilip Gersappe at Stony
Brook University, developing models for and simulating various
phenomena in materials science using a technique from computational
fluid dynamics known as the lattice Boltzmann method. This research
was certainly the most rewarding of my high school experiences, in
part because I learned a great deal from Prof. Gersappe about fluid
dynamics, modeling, and even the general process of theoretical
research; but perhaps even more because I was also given the freedom
to pursue and experiment with my own thoughts and ideas. This is
representative of my later mathematical pursuits too: I have felt most
fulfilled in more open, research-like environments, where I can truly
understand things and find inspiration by playing with and exploring
both my and my teachers' and peers' ideas.

The very first example of this lies at perhaps the root of my interest
in pure mathematics. Near the end of my high school research I at
times found myself slightly dissatisfied: the models I was developing
produced qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable simulations, but
why? I had a sort of cartoon understanding of the lattice Boltzmann
method, but felt I must be missing a more precise, logical
understanding. I followed my curiosity and learned a bit of theory
about the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics and how one
discretizes such a thing for computational models. I distinctly
remember finally understanding something about differential equations
on the back of a receipt during a materials science lecture, and just
jittering deliriously in my seat. Moments like this led to further
curiosity about pure mathematics, and after rummaging around the
internet a bit for advice on where to start, I discovered Spivak's
*Calculus*. I worked through the book on and off during my senior year
as a side project, hoping to more rigorously understand the concepts
appearing in my high school calculus class and my research. This
independent reading led to what someone very generous might call my
high school thesis (in reality the extended essay for my IB Diploma),
an exposition of the Riemann and Darboux definitions of the integral.

# Academic experiences: college

The resources and opportunities at Harvard allowed me to tie these
loose strands of curiosity into a knot of utter mathematical zeal at
my core. This began when I decided to give the infamous Math 55 a go
at the start of my first semester and, well, I just kept going. I was
exhilarated learning from and collaborating with brilliant and driven
classmates; my closest friendships came about not over coffee or at
parties, but over mathematics in a basement which we gladly called
home. And in my first exposure to abstract algebra, I found thinking
about mathematics by understanding abstraction and structure
completely absorbing, an experience I didn't manage to find in high
school classes and contests. Before I knew it, I was spending at least
thirty hours per week thinking about math (and probably another thirty
hours per week dreaming about it). The course inspired me to seriously
pursue mathematics, but it has been my subsequent self-driven work
which has been most stimulating and most decisively shaped my
mathematical trajectory.

In the summer after my freshman year I stayed on campus to read about
the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras under the
supervision of Prof. Joe Harris. This project in particular gave me
the opportunity to learn and familiarize myself with the ubiquitous
language of general and differential topology, allowing me to take our
sequence of algebraic topology courses in my sophomore year. Since
then I have been engrossed in understanding the beautiful connections
forged by algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In my junior fall,
one of my friends and I decided to undertake an independent reading
course on simplicial and abstract homotopy theory under the
supervision of Dr. Emily Riehl. This was easily one of our best
decisions: being able to work through the mathematics together at a
blackboard in a small office, in free dialogue guided by an expert,
was immensely more fun and instructive for us than almost any
lecture. The material was eye-opening too, illustrating how one can
transport ideas from topology, where one has pictures and geometric
intuition, to entirely algebraic settings, which can sometimes be
dauntingly formal. In the same semester I participated in an
undergraduate reading seminar, supervised by Dr. Hiro Tanaka. This
gave me the chance to give my first somewhat-formal talk for a
specifically mathematical audience, on the proof and some applications
of the Dold-Kan correspondence.

Most recently, I spent last summer learning about a few riveting
aspects of stable homotopy theory under the supervision of Prof. Jacob
Lurie. In particular, I focused on understanding Thom's
homotopy-theoretic classification of unoriented manifolds up to a
geometric equivalence relation called cobordism, and subsequently an
analogous result of Quillen for the slight variant known as complex
cobordism. The latter computation leads to some miraculous theory
connecting topology, geometry, algebra, and number theory. Being able
to freely discuss and ask questions about these expansive connections
in meetings with Prof. Lurie was vital to my understanding both the
details and the bigger picture of this theory, especially because of
his ability to tell unbelievably clear stories that highlight the
motivation behind abstract ideas. This inspired me to continue working
in this area with Prof. Lurie for my senior thesis, in which I look to
study certain questions about equivariant cohomology theories.

During my graduate work I hope to continue researching these ideas,
and learn about and discover other stunning ways in which homotopy
theory connects diverse objects, fields, and people in mathematics. As
another example, the interface of algebraic topology and theoretical
physics is currently a highly active area of research, one which I am
keen to explore.
