The tree method is an algorithm developed by Robert Lang which designs
an origami base with a collection of flaps which are arranged so that
their projection to the ground is a specified metric tree. These flaps
can then be molded to transform the base into something more
artistic. The example here is a base with nine flaps whose projection
is a star graph, designed by the tree method. I've kept it simple and
unartistic because origami is hard for me. But that's not my fault:
the origami design problem solved by the tree method is NP-hard!
