\section*{\emph{The Crying of Lot 49}, passage grouping}

\subsection*{Communication/information/entropy}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=5pt]
\item As if, on some other frequency, or out of the eye of some
  whirlwind rotating too slow for her heated skin even to feel the
  centrifugal coolness of, words were being spoken. [p. 14]

\item ``To keep it up to some kind of a reasonable volume, each member
  has to send at least one letter a week through the Yoyodyne
  system. If you don't, you get fined.'' He opened his letter and
  howed Oedipa and Metzger.

  \emph{Dear Mike}, it said, \emph{how are you? Just though I'd drop
    you a note. How's your book coming? Guess that's all for now. See
    you at The Scope.}

  ``That's how it is,'' Fallopian confessed bitterly, ``most of the
  time.'' [p. 39]

\item Oedipa wondered whether, at the end of this (if it were supposed
  to end), she too might not be left with only compiled memories of
  clues, announcements intimations, but never the central truth itself,
  which must somehow each time be too bright her memory to hold; which
  must always blaze out, destroying its own message irreversibly,
  leaving an over exposed blank when the ordinary world came
  back. [p. 76]

\item As the Demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold, the
  system was said to lose entropy. But somehow the loss was offset by
  the information the Demon gained about what molecules were where.

  ``Communication is the key,'' cried Nefastis. ``The Demon passes his
  data on to the sensitive, and the sensitive must reply in
  kind. There are untold billions of molecules in that box. The Demon
  collects data on each and every one. At some deep psychic level he
  must get through. The sensitive must receive that staggering set of
  energies, and feed back something like the same quantity of
  information. To keep it all cycling. On the secular level all we can
  see is one piston, hopefully moving. One little movement, against
  all that massive complex of indormation, destroyed over and over
  with each power stroke.''

  ``Help,'' said Oedipa, ``you're not reaching me.'' [pp. 84--85]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Self vs. world}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=5pt]
\item ``Why would he do a thing like that,'' Roseman puzzled, after
  reading the letter.

  ``You mean die?''

  ``No,'' said Roseman, ``name you to help execute it.''

  ``He was unpredictable.'' They went to lunch. Roseman tried to play
  footsie with her under the table. She was wearing boots, and
  couldn't feel much of anything. So, insulated, she decided not to
  make any fuss. [p. 10]

\item But all that had then gone on between them had really never
  escaped the confinement of that tower. In Mexico City they somehow
  wanered into an exhibition of paintings by the beautiful Spanish
  exile Remedios Varo: in the central painting of a triptych, titled
  ``Bordando el Manto Terrestre,'' were a number of frail girls with
  heart-shaped faces, huge eyes, spun-gold hair, prisoners in the top
  room of a circular tower, embroidering a kind of tapestry which
  spillled out the slit windows and into a void, seeking hopelessly to
  fill the void: for all the other buildings and creatures, all the
  waves, ships and forests of the earth were contained in this
  tapestry, and the tapestry was the world. Oedipa, perverse, had
  stood in fron of the painting and cried. . . . She could carry the
  sadness of the moment with her that way forever, see the world
  refracted through those tears, those specific tears, as if incies as
  yet unfound varied in important ways from cry to cry. [p. 11]

\item She stood between the public booth and the rented car, in the
  night, her isolation complete, and tried to face toward the sea. But
  she'd lost her bearings. She turned, pivoting on one stacked heel,
  could find no mountains either. As if there could be no barriers
  between herself and teh rest of the land. San Narciso at that moment
  lost (the loss pure, instant, spherical, the sound of a stainless
  orchestral chime held among the stars and struck lightly), gave up
  its residue of uniqueness for her; became a name again, was assumed
  back into the American continuity of crust and mantle. Piece
  Inverarity was really dead. [pp. 146--147]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Strange/confusing images}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=5pt]
\item ``It's clearer now,'' he said, rather formal. ``A few months ago
  it got quite cloudy. You see, in spring, when the dandelions begin
  to bloom again, the wine goes through a fermentation. As if they
  remembered.''

  No, though Oedipa, sad. As if their home cemetery in some way still
  didexist, in a land where you could somehow walk and not need the
  East San Narciso Freeway, and bones still could rest in peace,
  nourishing ghosts of danelions, no one to plow them up. As if the
  dead really do persist, even in a bottle of wine. [p. 79]

\item In Golden Gate Park she came on a circle of children in their
  nightclothes, who told her they were dreaming the gathering. But
  that the dream was really no different from being awake, because in
  the mornings when they got up they felt tired, as if they'd been up
  most of the night. Whe their mothers though they were out playing
  they were really curled up in cupboards of the neighbors' houses, in
  teh platforms up in trees, in secretly-hollowed nests inside hedges,
  sleeping, making up for these hours. [p. 96]

\item ``Government supply swastikas?'' Oedipa said.

  ``Hell no.'' He gave her an insider's wink. ``Got this little
  factory down outside of San Diego,'' he told her, ``got a dozen of
  your niggers, say, they can sure turn them old armbands out. You'd
  be amazed how that little number's selling. I took some space in a
  couple of the girlie magazines, and I had to hire two extra niggers
  last week just to take care of the mail.''

  . . .

  She left, wondering if she should've called him something, or tried
  to hit him with any of a dozen surplus, heavy, blunt objects in easy
  reach. There had been no witnesses. Why hadn't she?

  You're chicken, she told herself, snapping her seat belt. This is
  America, you live in it, you let it happen. Let in
  unfurl. [pp. 122--123]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Analysis}

These three ideas---communication/information/entropy, self vs. world,
and strange/confusing images (i.e. my confusion)---were the general
pictures I was able to filter out of \emph{The Crying of Lot 49}. The
obsessions with Maxwell's Demon, letters, and communication in the
novel seem to be exploring what I think is essentially the ``static''
of reality that Wallace referenced when discussing writing
non-fiction. Oedipa's main conflict seems to be facing this static of
reality and the world, and this drives her transformation from
something ``insulated'' to being lost in ``the American continuity of
crust and mantle''. Finally I had to include some of the beautiful or
funny, but absolutely perplexing, descriptions and images which form
so much of the novel. The scenes Oedipa finds herself in as she drifts
through San Francisco, like the children in the park, are bizarre and
confusing. As was suggested last lecture, perhaps this bizarreness and
confusion is a reflection Oedipa's journey in the language.
