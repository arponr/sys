The clatter of the closing bathroom
door, its inexplicably inconsistent
locking mechanism demanding its entrant
first to turn its (the door's) knob just
vaguely in a direction chosen at that
very moment by some especially
mischevious Maxwell-type demon and only
then allowing its knob's central outset
button to be clicked inwards---the
clatter knocks my mind sufficiently off
balance that for a moment I don't know
whether the sounds to come are of 9am or
1am ablutions.

The waves rush electrically in,
vibrating, osmosing through the dunes
waiting on shore and into the still,
expectant earth, coursing through
awakening tendrils, resonating,
dissolving, resolving---and the amber
earth is alive, atop itself, twisting
and surging and carried to sea by
electric blue waves.

I have trouble understanding
thanksgiving, says the very educated and
evolved boy.

The night was young then, but is now
bleeding into morning. And he is no
longer educated or evolved and he does
not understand. He is a boy left feeling
strangely old in a doorway facing the
night, barefoot, longing strangely for
childhood friends not to leave.

Two humans stand in the autumn of a New
York forest. Radically old wood towers
around them; equally old wood lies
hollowed, carved, and stringed in the
arms of one. The wood and the strings
and the humans vibrate. Listen: the
vibrations are in New York and in your
room and ripple out from your heart and
for two moments you feel the beauty of
evolution, history, time, entropy,
everything which created a species that
stands in melody and harmony among
shimmering sunlight and dancing
leaves. And forget the two subsequent
moments of cynicism, for it is not
actually True that the bacteria and the
insects have as much claim to the Earth
as you. The Earth pulses with the beat
of your music. And forget the two
subsubequent moments during which you
realize that maybe the insects think
they are making music too because what
is music and maybe we are just insects
and...

Do not deduce yourself out of the
Truth. Remember beauty and vibrations
and your heart. Remember.

I am playing a song that I wrote on
piano. A carefully chosen piano in a
carefully locked room in a carefully
secluded basement. Alone, for myself, I
play. Murmurs creep through the closed
door. People passing by
probably. Hopefully. Keep playing, make
mistakes, who cares, I'm tired. It
finishes plainly, three plain chords in
the left hand. I think I'm done playing
for now, I'm tired. Knock, knock cold
and sharp on the hard door. I rise and
with great hesitation pull open the
door. That was one of the most beautiful
things I've ever heard, she says. Her
smile leaps through the door onto my
face. Who wrote that, she says. That
could be in the score of a movie by that
director, you know, the director of that
movie, she says. I feel the words wade
into my heart. Float serenely for hours,
then sink deep. Thank you from the
bottom of my heart.
