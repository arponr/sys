\prob{1}

Let $g,g' \in G$. Let $g_i \in S$. We claim that
\begin{equation}
  \label{change-product} \tag{$*$}
  h_{g_i,gg'} = h_{g_i,g}h_{\phi(g_ig),g'}.
\end{equation}
By definition we have $g_ig = h_{g_i,g}\phi(g_ig)$ and $\phi(g_ig)g' =
h_{\phi(g_ig),g'}\phi(\phi(g_ig)g')$, implying
\[
g_igg' = h_{g_i,g}\phi(g_ig)g' =
h_{g_i,g}h_{\phi(g_ig),g'}\phi(\phi(g_ig)g').
\]
So to prove (\ref{change-product}) it suffices to prove
\begin{equation}
  \label{iterate-phi} \tag{$**$}
  \phi(\phi(g_ig)g') = \phi(g_igg').
\end{equation}
But this is clear since $\phi(g_ig) = hg_ig$ and hence
$\phi(\phi(g_ig)g') = h'hg_igg'$ for some $h,h' \in H$.

So now we have
\begin{align*}
  V(gg') &= \prod_i h_{g_i,gg'} \mod H' = \prod_i
  h_{g_i,g}h_{\phi(g_ig),g'} \mod H' \\ &= \l(\prod_i h_{g_i,g} \mod
  H'\r) \cdot \l(\prod_i h_{\phi(g_ig),g'} \mod H'\r),
\end{align*}
where the last equality is by the fact that $H/H' = H^{\ab}$ is
abelian. But $g_i \mapsto \phi(g_ig)$ is an automorphism of $S$ since
the map $g_i \mapsto \phi(g_ig^{-1})$ is an inverse by
(\ref{iterate-phi}). Thus we have
\[
V(gg') = \l(\prod_i h_{g_i,g} \mod H'\r)\l(\prod_i h_{g_i,g'} \mod
H'\r) = V(g)V(g'),
\]
as desired.

\prob{2}

By definition of the $f_i$, we can take
\[
\{x_is^j : 1 \le i \le r, 0 \le j < f_i\}
\]
as a set of coset representatives for $H \bs G / F$. Then for each
$i,j$ we have for
\[
\phi(x_is^js) = \phi(x_is^{j+1}) =
\begin{cases}
  x_is^{j+1} & j < f_i - 1 \\
  x_i & j = f_i - 1.
\end{cases}
\]
Therefore
\[
V(s) = \prod_{i,j} x_is^{j+1}\phi(x_is^{j+1})^{-1} = \prod_i
x_is^{f_i}x_i^{-1}.
\]

\prob{3}

\subprob{a}

Let $s \in G$, and define $x_i,f_i$ as in Problem 2. By definition we
have $x_is^{f_i} = hx_i$ for some $h \in H$. Then since $H \subseteq
Z(G)$ it follows that
\[
x_is^{f_i} = hx_i = x_ih \implies s^{f_i} = h \in H.
\]
Then by Problem 2 it follows (again using $H \subseteq Z(G)$) that
\[
V(s) = \prod x_is^{f_i}x_i^{-1} = \prod_i s^{f_i} = s^{\sum f_i}.
\]
Since the $f_i$ are the orbit sizes of the action of $\langle s
\rangle$ on $H \bs G$ it follows that $\sum f_i = [G : H] = n$, so
we're done.

\subprob{b}

Since $H$ is abelian, $G'$ is in the kernel of $V : G \to H$. But
since $V$ is given by $g \mapsto g^n$ this implies $G'$ has exponent
$n$. Now, since for $x,y \in G$ the commutator $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ only
depends on classes of $x,y$ in $G/Z(G)$, the fact that $[G:Z(G)] = n$
implies $G'$ is finitely generated. Now consider the injection (of
sets)
\[
\frac{G'}{G' \cap Z(G)} \inj \frac{G}{Z(G)}.
\]
The right-hand side is finite, so $G' \cap Z(G)$ has finite index in
$G'$, and is thus finitely generated. Since it is also abelian and has
exponent $n$, it must in fact be finite. It follows that $G'$ is
finite.

\prob{4}

Fix notation as in the hint. We first show that the map $\xi \c H \bs G
/ F \to \{\p'_i\}$ sending the coset $HgF$ to $g\P \cap \O_{K'}$ is a
well-defined bijection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Well-definedness: Let $g' = hgf$ with $h \in H$ and $f \in
  F$. Since $F$, the group generated by $s$, is precisely the
  decomposition group associated to $\P$, we have $f\P = \P$. Thus
  \[
  g'\P \cap \O_{K'} = hgf\P \cap \O_{K'} = hg\P \cap \O_{K'}.
  \]
  Then since $H$ fixes $K'$, we have
  \[
  hg\P \cap \O_{K'} = h(g\P \cap \O_{K'}) = g\P \cap \O_{K'}.
  \]
  This proves well-definedness of $\xi$.
\item Surjectivity: For any $\p'_i$ we can choose some prime $\P'$ in
  $L$ above it, and since $G$ acts transitively on the primes in $L$
  above $\p$ we can write $\P' = g\P$ for some $g \in G$. Then $\p'_i
  = \xi(g)$.
\item Injectivity: Suppose
  \[
  g\P \cap \O_{K'} = \p'_i = g'\P \cap \O_{K'}.
  \]
  Since $H$ acts transitively on the primes in $L$ above $\p'_i$ we
  can write for some $h \in H$,
  \[
  hg'\P = g\P \implies g^{-1}hg'\P = \P \implies g^{-1}hg' \in F,
  \]
  and hence we can write $g = hg'f$ for some $f \in F$.
\end{itemize}
Thus we can pick coset representatives $\{g_i\}$ of $H \bs G / F$ such
that $g_i\P \cap \O_{K'} = \p'_i$. Recall that then
\[
g_isg_i^{-1} = g_i(\P, L/K)g_i^{-1} = (g_i\P, L/K).
\]
So by Problem 2 it follows that
\[
\mathrm{Ver}((\P,L_{\ab}/K)) = V(s) = \prod_i (g_i\P, L/K)^{f_i} \mod
H'.
\]
Since $f_i$ is the minimal power of $(g_i\P,L/K)$ which lies in $H$,
i.e. which fixes $K'$, it follows by definition of the Frobenius
element that $f_i$ is the residue field degree of $\p'_i = g_i\P \cap
\O_{K'}$ over $\p$ and that $(g_i\P,L/K)^{f_i} = (g_i\P,L/K')$. Then
since $(g_i\P,L/K') \mod H' = (\p'_i, L'_{\ab}/K')$, we conclude that
\[
\mathrm{Ver}((\P,L_{\ab}/K)) = \prod_i (\p'_i, L'_{\ab}/K') =
(\p\O_{K'}, L'_{\ab}/K'),
\]
as desired.
