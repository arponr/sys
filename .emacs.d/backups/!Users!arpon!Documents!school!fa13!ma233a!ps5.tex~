\prob{1}

\subprob{a}

The base change $f_Y : X \times_Y Y \to Y$ of $f$ by $\id_Y$ factors
as $X \times_Y Y \to X \to Y$, where the first morphism is projection
and the second morphism is $f$. Thus $f_Y$ being injective implies $f$
is injective.

Now let $x \in X$, and $y \coloneq f(x)$. Let $K$ be the algebraic
closure of $k(y)$. By hypothesis the base change $X \times_Y \Spec K
\to X \times_Y \Spec K$ is injective, so $X \times_Y \Spec K$ is a
point (as a space). Now since the composition $\Spec k(x) \to \Spec
k(y) \to Y$ is evidently equal to the composition \Spec k(x) \to X \to
Y$, we have that
\[
\Spec k(x) \times_{\Spec k(y)} \Spec K \simeq \Spec k(x) \times_Y
\Spec K \simeq \Spec k(x) \times_X (X \times_Y \Spec K)
\]
is just the fibre $(X \times_Y \Spec K)_x$. But since the
scheme-theoretic fibre agrees set-theoretically with the topological
fibre and $X \times_Y \Spec K$ is a point, it follows that
\[
\Spec(k(x) \otimes_{k(y)} K) \simeq \Spec k(x) \times_{\Spec k(y)}
\Spec K
\]
is just a point. I.e., $k(x) \otimes_{k(y)} K$ has precisely one
prime, which implies\footnote{I can prove this, but don't want to do
  that here.} $k(x)$ is purely inseparable over
$k(y)$.

\prob{3}

Let $h \coloneqq f \times g : X \to Y \times_S Y$. On spaces, we then
have $x \in Z \coloneqq h^{-1}(\Delta_{Y/S}(Y))$ if and only if $f(x)
= g(x)$. Since $Y$ is separated, $\Delta_{Y/S}(Y)$ is closed in $Y
\times_S Y$, and hence $Z$ is closed in $X$. Moreover $Z \supseteq U$
by hypothesis, but by density this implies $Z = X$. Thus $f = g$ on
spaces.

Now, by glueing the induced morphisms $f^\sharp,g^\sharp$ agree if and
only if their restrictions $f^\sharp,g^\sharp : \O_Y(V_j) \to
\O_X(U_i)$ agree, where $\{U_i\},\{V_j\}$ are open covers of $X,Y$,
respectively. Since any open subscheme of a reduced scheme is reduced
by definition, we are then reduced to the case that $X \simeq \Spec A$
with $A$ reduced and $Y \simeq \Spec B$. Then $f^\sharp,g^\sharp$
agree if and only if the induced maps on global sections $B \to A$
agree. Let $b \in B$ and let $a \coloneq f^\sharp(b) -
g^\sharp(b)$. By hypothesis, $a|_U = 0$, or $a \in I(U)$. But by
density of $U$, we have
\[
X = \oline U = V(I(U)) \subseteq V(\{a\}),
\]
implying $a$ is nilpotent. But since $A$ is reduced, this gives $a =
0$, so $f^\sharp(b) = g^\sharp(b)$. Since $b$ was arbitrary we are
done.

\prob{4}

\subprob{a}

Since $U \to X$ is injective, it is separated. Then the composition $U
\to X \to S$ is separated.\footnote{I did this in a really dumb,
  explicit way before Allen reminded me that injective maps are
  separated, which is really awesome.}

\subprob{b}

The unique morphism $X \to \Spec \Z$ can be factored as $X \to \Spec R
\to \Spec \Z$, where $\Spec R \to \Spec \Z$ is the unique morphism
induced by $\Z \to R$. Since any morphism of affine schemes is
separated, it follows that $X \to \Spec \Z$ is separated if and only
if $X \to \Spec R$ is separated.

\subprob{c}

By definition $X_y \coloneqq X \times_Y \Spec k(y)$, so the morphism
$X_y \to \Spec k(y)$ is just a base-change of the separated morphism
$X \to Y$, hence separated.

\prob{5}

We have $X$ and $S$ as $S$-schemes via the morphisms $f$ and $\id_S$,
respectively. Then a section $g : S \to X$ of $f$ as schemes is
precisely a morphism of $S$-schemes. Since $X$ is separated over $S$,
the graph morphism $\Gamma_g : S \to S \times_S X$ is a closed
immersion. But the projection $\pi : S \times_S X \to X$ is an
isomorphism, hence a closed immersion, so then $g = \pi \circ
\Gamma_g$ is a closed immersion.
