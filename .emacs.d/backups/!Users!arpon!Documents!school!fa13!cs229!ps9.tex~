\prob{1}

\subprob{a}

Note first that if
\[
A \coloneqq
\begin{pmatrix}
  Y & X \\ X^t & Z
\end{pmatrix}
\succeq 0,
\]
then firstly $A$ must be symmetric, which clearly holds if and only if
$Y$ and $Z$ are symmetric. (Ok, I thought I would, but I'm not going
to write all this out rigorously, because it doesn't seem worth it.)
We define the matrices $A_i \in \R^{(m+n) \times (m+n)}$ for $i \ge 1$
in the minimisation (3) as all those with a $-1$ in a location and
symetrically across the diagonal, and $0$ elsewhere. We set the
constant $A_0$ to be the matrix with entries $-M_{i,j}$ for $(i,j) \in
\Omega$ in the correct entries of $A$ corresponding to $X$, and
transposed in the entries of $A$ corresponding to $X^t$.

The entries of $x$ correspond to the upper diagonal entries of $Y$ and
$Z$ and the entries of $X$ which do not lie in $\Omega$. Each
coordinate naturally corresponds to one of the $A_i$ matrices defined
above by its location in $A$. Then we set $B \coloneqq 0$ so that
requiring this linear combination be $\preceq B$ is equivalent to
requiring $A \succeq 0$.

Finally we set $c$ to have $1$ in the locations corresponding to the
diagonal entries of $Y$ and $Z$ in the vector $x$ and $0$ elsewhere,
so that $c^tx = \tr(Y) + \tr(Z)$. \win

\subprob{b}

Let $X = U \Sigma V^t$ the SVD. Define $Y \coloneqq U \Sigma U^t \in
\R^{m \times m}$ and $Z \coloneqq V \Sigma V^t \in \R^{n \times
  n}$. Then by the cyclic property of the trace
\[
\tr(Y) = \tr(U^tU\Sigma) = \tr(\Sigma) = \|X\|_*,
\]
and similarly $\tr(Z) = \|X\|_*$, so $\tr(Y) + \tr(Z) \le 2t$. Next,
note that
\[
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
  Y & X \\ X^t & Z
\end{pmatrix}}_A
=
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
  U & 0 \\ 0 & V
\end{pmatrix}}_{B^t}
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
  \Sigma & \Sigma \\ \Sigma & \Sigma
\end{pmatrix}}_C
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
  U^t & 0 \\ 0 & V^t
\end{pmatrix}}_B.
\]
Certainly $A$ and $C$ are symmetric as defined. Thus for any $x \in
\R^{m+n}$ we have $x^tAx = (Bx)^tC(Bx)$, and hence to show $A$ is
positive semidefinite it suffices to show $C$ is positive
semidefinite. But since $\Sigma$ is diagonal with nonnegative entries,
this is immediate from the Gershgorin circle theorem. Thus $A \succeq
0$ and we win. \win

\subprob{c}

Suppose $A,B$ are symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Then
$A^{1/2},B^{1/2}$ are also symmetric so by the cyclic property of the
trace we have
\[
\tr(AB) = \tr(A^{1/2}A^{1/2}B^{1/2}B^{1/2}) =
\tr(B^{1/2}A^{1/2}A^{1/2}B^{1/2}) = \|A^{1/2}B^{1/2}\|_F^2 \ge 0.
\]
\win

\subprob{d}

Notation as in (b). Observe that $(UU^t)^2 = UU^t$ and $(VV^t)^2 =
VV^t$, so both $UU^t$ and $VV^t$ are projection operators. Moreover,
since $A$ is positive semidefinite it is immediate that $Y$ and $Z$
are positive semidefinite. These two facts imply that
\[
\tr(UU^tY) \le \tr(Y) \quad\text{and}\quad \tr(VV^tZ) \le \tr(Z).
\]
(I'm omitting the details: roughly, if we consider a basis of $\R^m$
consisting of a basis for $\mathrm{im}(UU^t)$ and its orthogonal
complement, then the projection $UU^t$ just kills off the diagonal
entries of $Y$ from the orthogonal complement, which must have been
nonnegative\footnote{My roommate Ben Kuhn (not in this class) made me
  realise this totally obvious fact.}  since $Y$ is positive
semidefinite.)

Next, consider the symmetric matrix
\[
W \coloneqq
\begin{pmatrix}
  UU^t & -UV^t \\ -VU^t & VV^t
\end{pmatrix},
\]
and observe that $W^2 = 2W$. In particular, for $x \in \R^{m+n}$
and $\lambda \in \R$ we have
\[
Wx = \lambda x \implies 2Wx = 2\lambda x \implies W^2x = 2\lambda x.
\]
This implies any twice any eigenvalue of $W$ is an eigenvalue of
$W^2$. But of course $W^2$ has nonnegative eigenvalues. Thus $W$ is
positive semidefinite. Then (c) implies that $\tr(WA) \ge 0$.

Now, expanding, we have
\begin{align*}
0 \le \tr(WA) &= \tr
\begin{pmatrix}
  UU^tY - U \Sigma U^t & * \\ * & VV^tZ - V \Sigma V^t
\end{pmatrix}
 \\ &= \tr(UU^tY) - \tr(U \Sigma U^t) + \tr(VV^tZ) - \tr(V \Sigma
 V^t).
\end{align*}
As in (b) we have $\tr(U \Sigma U^t) = \tr(V \Sigma V^t) =
\|X\|_*$. Combining this with our first set of inequalities, the above
implies
\[
2\|X\|_* = \tr(U \Sigma U^t) + \tr(V \Sigma V^t) \le \tr(UU^tY) +
\tr(VV^tZ) \le 2t,
\]
so $\|X\|_* \le t$. Combining this result with (b) clearly gives that
the same $X \in \R^{m \times n}$ will minimise (2) and (4) from the
problem set, so solving them are equivalent. \win
