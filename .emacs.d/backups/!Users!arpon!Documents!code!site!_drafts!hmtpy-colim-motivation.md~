I find it really nice to be able to think about things via universal
properties. In particular I know and love how to do this for limits
and colimits in ordinary categories. But in homotopy theory things
these notions need to be fixed slightly, since they're not homotopy
invariant. (The canonical example in the familiar realm of spaces is
that $D^n \from S^{n-1} \to D^n$ has pushout $S^n$ but $* \from
S^{n-1} \to *$ has pushout $*$.) This leads one to define homotopy
limits and homotopy colimits, which are homotopy invariant. But how do
I think of these via universal properties? Not understanding these
things all too well, and seeking to retreat into familiar territory,
I'm tempted to just think of them as limits as colimits in the
homotopy category. But this is so, so wrong! This post contains two
examples I found on [the][exist] [internet][match] which helped hammer
this point home.

\begin{notation}
Let $\H$ denote the homotopy category of pointed spaces (for
definiteness maybe take this to be pointed CW complexes and maps up to
homotopy). For $X,Y \in \H$ denote $\hom_\H(X,Y)$ by $[X,Y]$.
\end{notation}

\begin{example}[A colimit which doesn't exist]
Consider the diagram
\[
\begin{xy}
  \xymatrix{
    S^1 \ar[r]_i \ar[d]^f & D^2 \\ S^1. &
  }
\end{xy}
\]
where $i$ is the canonical inclusion and $f$ is a degree $2$ map. We
know this diagram has a homotopy pushout: we can replace $f$ by a
cofibration and then just take an ordinary pushout. But we can show
that this diagram has no colimit in $\H$. Suppose there were a pushout
$X \in \H$: then for $Y \in \H$ we have
\[
[X,Y] \iso [S^1,Y] \times_{[S^1, Y]} [D^2,Y] \iso \pi_1(Y)
\times_{\pi_1(Y)} *
\]
where the map $\pi_1(Y) \to \pi_1(Y)$ is multiplication by $2$ by
definition of $f$. Thus $[X,Y] \iso \pi_1(Y)[2]$, the $2$-torsion of
$\pi_1(Y)$. We will prove that this functor $Y \mapsto \pi_1(Y)[2]$
cannot be corepresentable.

First, we have $[X,S^0] \iso \pi_1(S^0)[2] \iso 0$
implying $X$ is connected. Thus for $G$ a (discrete) group,
considering the classification of principal $G$-bundles
(i.e. $G$-coverings) gives isomorphisms
\[
\hom_\Grp(\pi_1(X),G) \iso H^1(X;G) \iso [X;BG] \iso \pi_1(BG)[2] \iso
G[2],
\]
natural in $G$. By Yoneda this implies $\pi_1(X) \iso \Z/2$. It
follows that we can construct maps $\RP^2 \to X \to \RP^\infty \iso
K(\Z/2,1)$ which are isomorphisms on $\pi_1$, and hence isomorphisms
on $H_1(-;\Z)$. Since $H_2(\RP^2;\Z) \iso 0 \iso H_2(\RP^\infty;\Z)$
it follows by the universal coefficient theorem that the composition
$\RP^2 \to \RP^\infty$ is an isomorphism on $H^2(-;\Z)$. But this is
impossible, for
\[
H^2(X;\Z) \iso [X,K(\Z,2)] \iso \pi_1(K(\Z,2))[2] \iso 0.
\]
\end{example}
