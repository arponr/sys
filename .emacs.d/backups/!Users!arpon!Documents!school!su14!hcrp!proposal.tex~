At the moment my foremost interest and passion is mathematics, and it
seems that this will be the case for the foreseeable future. I can't say
this has always been true though. I owe a great deal to Harvard's
uniquely flexible and challenging department of mathematics, for I don't
believe there are many other places on Earth where I could have become
so engrossed in and learned so much math in two and a half years.

Of course, I was not \emph{uninterested} in math prior to enrolling at
Harvard. I was on my high school's math team and did fairly well in
local competitions, I took the AMC a couple of times, I participated in
ARML, etc. But I didn't even qualify for AIME and didn't come close to
qualifying for the final rounds at ARML. Moreover, I didn't have any
strong desire to get there. I was doing math as a sort of hobby, a
social activity, but never felt motivated to study or practice for these
contests. I didn't know what \emph{Art of Problem Solving} was and
wasn't looking for it.

Not even three years have passed, but my relationship with mathematics
has changed a great deal. Last semester I did an independent study on
simplicial homotopy theory and model categories, took the first-semester
course in the theory of schemes, and gave a talk on the Dold-Kan
correspondence in a reading group on infinity-categories. This semester
I am taking graduate courses in complex analysis on Riemann surfaces and
vector bundles in algebraic topology, as well as continuing in the
theory of schemes. In addition, this year I have been a course assistant
for our undergraduate topology and algebra courses, and have been
teaching somewhat younger kids (8--10 year olds!) in the Math Circle a
bit about set theory and graph theory.

I think it all began when I discovered Spivak's \emph{Calculus} during
my final year of high school. I read the book on and off, learning about
what was \emph{actually} going on in my calculus class and finding the
process of placing these intuitive ideas on rigorous foundations quite
fascinating. I ended up writing an expository paper about Riemann and
Darboux integration for my IB diploma, and then decided to study
multivariable calculus and linear algebra that summer before coming to
Harvard.

So my interest in math was growing rapidly. But in just the first few
weeks at Harvard, ``rapid'' transformed into absolutely ridiculous. I
decided to give the infamous Math 55 a go at the start of the semester
and, well, I just kept going. I was exhilarated learning from and
collaborating with an incredible set of classmates and found thinking
about problems by understanding abstraction and structure beautiful and
inspiring, something I didn't manage to find during high school and in
contests. Before I knew it, I was spending at least thirty hours per
week thinking about math (and another thirty hours per week dreaming
about it).

Math 55 and my entire freshman year were transformative, and I haven't
looked back. I am currently deeply interested in understanding the ideas
of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, and curious about how
these fields interact and can be applied to problems in other areas like
number theory. Needless to say, I am only at the start of understanding
these ideas. But I believe I am only at the start of my mathematical
life. I plan to continue pursuing these ideas in graduate school and
afterwards as a professional mathematician.

While I have immersed myself in mathematics during the past few years, I
have not yet had the opportunity to do original research in the subject.
I enjoyed myself as a software engineering intern at Google last summer,
but at the end of it all I really just missed spending my days thinking
about math. My experiences have convinced me that I am most fulfilled
and stimulated by mathematics. Participating in an REU will give me an
opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge, and engage in the subject
in a more hands-on and creative way.
