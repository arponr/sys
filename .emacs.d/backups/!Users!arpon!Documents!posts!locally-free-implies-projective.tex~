\section{Introduction}

I wanted to write down two proofs of the fact that locally free
modules are projective, something I ended up thinking about for a few
hours while learning the tiniest bit of commutative algebra this
summer\footnote{from some really fun notes and problems from a course
  taught by Dennis Gaitsgory last year}. It's a nice fact in that it
made me think about how to use locally free, finitely presented, and
projective modules, and what these adjectives actually mean. Formally,
I'm going to prove the following.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be a (commutative, unital) ring and $M$ a locally free
  module over $A$. Then any short exact sequence $0 \to N \to M' \to M
  \to 0$ of $A$-modules splits.
\end{theorem}

\noindent But first let's review some definitions.

\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}
  Let $A$ a ring. An $A$-module $M$ is \textit{finitely}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{generated} if there is a surjection $A^{\oplus n} \equivto
    M$ for some $n \in \N$,
  \item \textit{presented} if there is a furthermore an exact sequence
    $A^{\oplus m} \to A^{\oplus n} \to M \to 0$ for some $m,n \in \N$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{A sort of explicit proof}

By definition of locally free we can choose $f_1, \ldots, f_n \in A$
such that $(f_1, \ldots, f_n) = (1)$ and $M_{f_i}$ a free
$A_{f_i}$-module.

\begin{lemma}
  Locally free modules are finitely presented.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $M, M'$ modules over $A$ with $M$ finitely presented and
  $S \subset A$ a multiplicative subset. Then the map
  \[
  \hom_A(M,M')_S \to \hom_{A_S}(M_S, M'_S)
  \]
  sending $\phi/s$ to the map $m/r \mapsto \phi(m)/(rs)$ is
  an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

Ok fix $1 \le i \le n$. By exactness of localisation we have an exact
sequence $0 \to N_{f_i} \to M'_{f_i} \to M_{f_i} \to 0$.
