\prob{1}

Let $f \c X \to \P^2$ be a holomorphic map whose image is not
contained in a line. For $i \in \{1,2\}$, let $p_i \c \P^2 \to \P^1$
be the projection $[z_0 : z_1 : z_2] \mapsto [z_0 : z_i]$. Denote
$z_i/z_0 \ce p_if \in \M(X)$. We first claim each $z_i/z_0$ is not
constant. If it were constant we would necessarily have $f(X)
\subseteq V(\lambda z_0 - \mu z_i)$ for some $\lambda,\mu \in \C$,
contradicting that $f(X)$ is not contained in a line. Therefore we
know from earlier lectures that $\M(X)$ is a finite extension of
$\C(z_1/z_0)$. In particular, $z_2/z_0$ must satisfy an irreducible
monic polynomial $F_0 \in \C(z_1/z_0)[t]$. Let $F \in \C[z_0,z_1,z_2]$
be the minimal degree homogenous polynomial such that $z_0^{-d}F =
F_0(z_2/z_0)$ as rational functions in the symbols $z_0,z_1,z_2$. It
is easy to see that $F$ is irreducible since $F_0$ is.

Since by definition $F_0(z_2/z_0) = 0 \in \M(X)$ we have that $f(X)
\subseteq V(F)$. So to finish we need only show that $f$ surjects onto
$V(F)$. As discussed in lecture, there is a normalisation of $V(F)$,
so for some finite set $C \subset V(F)$ containing all singular
points, $V(F) - C$ is isomorphic to a finitely punctured Riemann
surface. In particular $V(F) - C$ is connected. Now, since all points
of $V(F) - C$ are nonsingular, they have local (holomorphic) charts on
$V(F)$ to $\C$. So by the open mapping theorem we have $f(X) \cap
(V(F) - C)$ is an open subset of $V(F) - C$. And since $X$ is compact
and $V(F)$ hausdorff, we also have $f(X) \cap (V(F)-C)$ closed in
$V(F)-C$. Since $X$ is connected and $f$ nonconstant we cannot have
$f(X) \subset C$, so connectedness of $V(F) - C$ implies $f(X)
\supseteq V(F) - C$. But $f(X)$ is closed in $V(F)$ so by
connectedness of $V(F)$ this implies $f(X) \supseteq V(F)$, and we're
done.

\prob{2}

Any $f \in \Aut(X)$ determines a linear automorphism $f^* \in
\GL(\Omega(X))$, defined by $f^*(\omega) \ce \omega \circ f$. Choosing
a basis $\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_g\}$ of $\Omega(X)$ determines an
isomorphism $\Omega(X) \simeq \C^g$, which then gives an isomorphism
$i \c \GL(\Omega(X)) \simeq \GL_g(\C)$. Let $j \c \GL_g(\C) \to
\PGL_g(\C) \simeq \Aut(\P^{g-1})$ be the quotient map. We then have a
map
\[
\rho \c \Aut(X) \to \Aut(\P^{g-1}), \quad f \mapsto j(i(f^*)).
\]
Since the canonical map is defined by $\phi(x) \ce [\omega_1(x) :
\cdots : \omega_g(x)]$, we evidently have $\phi \circ f =
\rho(f) \circ \phi$ for $f \in \Aut(X)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{3}

\subprob{i}

Let $f \in \Aut(\P^2) \simeq \PGL_3(\C)$ be an involution, and let $F
\in \GL_3(\C)$ be a representative of $f$. Since $f$ has order $2$ we
must have $F^2 = \lambda \cdot \id$ for some $\lambda \in \C^*$. This
implies $F$ is diagonalisable with possible eigenvalues
$\{\lambda^{1/2}, -\lambda^{1/2}\}$. Thus, one eigenspace of $F$ must
have dimension at least $2$. Since $f$ clearly fixes the
projectivisations of the eigenspaces of $F$, this implies $f$ fixes a
line in $\P^2$.

\subprob{ii}

Let $X$ be a non-hyperelliptic Riemann surface of genus $3$. Recall
from lecture this implies the canonical map $\phi \c X \to \P^2$ is an
embedding. Let $f \in \Aut(X)$ be an involution. Let $\rho \c \Aut(X)
\to \Aut(\P^2)$ be the representation constructed in Problem 2. Then
$\rho(f)^2 = \rho(f^2) = \rho(\id_\C) = \id_{\P^2}$ so $\rho(f)$ is an
involution on $\P^2$. By (i), this implies $\rho(f)$ fixes a line $L
\subset \P^2$. Since $\phi \circ f = \rho(f) \circ \phi$ and $\phi$ is
an embedding, to show $f$ has a fixed point it suffices to show
$\phi(X) \cap L \ne \emptyset$.

To do so, we use Problem 1. Note that if $\phi(X)$ were contained in a
line, then we would in fact have an embedding $\phi \c X \to
\P^1$. Since $\phi$ is holomorphic this would have to be an
isomorphism, contradicting that $X$ has genus $3$. Thus $\phi(X)$ is
an algebraic variety (of codimension $1$) in $\P^2$. It is a basic
fact in geometry that this implies $\phi(X) \cap L \ne
\emptyset$. (Otherwise $\phi(X)$ would be a projective subvariety of
the affine space $\P^2 - L$, so would have to be a point,
contradiction.)

\subprob{iii}

Consider the hyperelliptic Riemann surface $X$ defined by $y^2 = x^8 -
1$. There is an involution $f \in \Aut(X)$ induced by the map $(x,y)
\mapsto (-x,-y)$. Certainly no point on $X$ corresponding to a pair
$(x,y)$ is fixed by $f$, so if $f$ has fixed points then it must fix
the two points $p,q$ at infinity. Suppose this is the case. Let $G \ce
\Z/2$ act on $X$ by the identity and $f$, and let $Y \ce X/G$. Then
the quotient $X \to Y$ is a degree $2$ covering of Riemann surfaces
ramified precisely at $p,q$. By constancy of degree $p,q$ have
multiplicity $2$. So if $Y$ has genus $g$ then Riemann-Hurwitz tells
us that
\[
2 - 2 \cdot 3 = 2(2 - 2g) - 2 \implies 4g = 6,
\]
a contradiction since $g \in \Z$. So indeed $f$ has no fixed points.

\subprob{iv}

We proceed similarly to (iii). Suppose $X$ is a Riemann surface of
even genus $g$ and $f \in \Aut(X)$ is an involution without fixed
points. Then the action of $G \ce \Z/2$ on $X$ via $f$ defines an
\emph{unramified} degree $2$ covering of Riemann surfaces $X \to Y \ce
X/G$. If $Y$ has genus $h$ then we have
\[
2 - 2g = 2(2 - 2h) \implies 4h = 2(1+g),
\]
a contradiction since $1+g$ is odd and $h \in \Z$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{4}

Let $X$ denote the Fermat quartic and $Y$ the octagon curve. We claim
there is no nonconstant holomorphic map $f \c X \to Y$. Suppose to the
contrary there were. Since $X$ has genus $3$ and $Y$ genus $2$,
Riemann-Hurwitz gives us
\[
2 - 2 \cdot 3 = \deg(f)(2 - 2 \cdot 2) - C \implies -4 = -2\deg(f) -
C.
\]
Obviously we can't have $\deg(f) = 1$ so we must have $\deg(f) = 2$
and $C = 0$. I.e., $f$ presents $X$ as an unbranched degree $2$ cover
of $Y$. But then sheet-interchange gives us an involution of $X$
without fixed points. By Problem 3(ii), if we show $X$ is not
hyperelliptic then we have a contradiction.

Suppose $X$ were hyperelliptic. Then from lecture we know that the
canonical map $X \to \P^2$ factors through a degree $2$ map $X \to
\P^1$. But recall we have computed a basis of $\Omega(X)$ in a
previous problem set to be
\[
\omega_1 \ce dx/y^2, \quad \omega_2 \ce dx/y^3, \quad \omega_3 \ce
x\,dx/y^3.
\]
Therefore the canonical map $X \to \P^2$ is given by
\[
[\omega_1 : \omega_2 : \omega_3] = [y : 1 : x],
\]
which evidently could not factor through a degree $2$ map, so
contradiction.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{5}

The claim is false. (This example was passed down to me from someone
who attended section.) Consider the projective curve $X \ce
V(zy^3-x^4-z^4) \subset \P^2$. The derivatives are given by
\[
\del_x = 4x^3, \quad \del_y = 3zy^2, \quad \del_z = y^3 - 4z^3.
\]
Thus $\del_x = \del_y = \del_z = 0 \implies x = y = z = 0$ which never
happens in $\P^2$, and hence $X$ indeed is a Riemann surface. Consider
the meromorphic function $f \ce x/z \c X \to \P^1$, this clearly has
degree $3$ and has branch points of multiplicity $3$ over infinity (at
$z = 0$) and over the four primitive eighth roots of unity $\zeta_8^i$
(at $y = 0$). Thus Riemann-Hurwitz tells us that, if $X$ has genus
$g$,
\[
2 - 2g = 3 \cdot 2 - 10 \implies g = 3.
\]
Now let $g \ce y/z \c X \to \P^1$ and consider the form $df/g^2$. The
only pole of $f$ is of order $3$ at $z=0$, so $df$ has a single pole
their of order $4$. And $df$ has zeros of order $2$ at the branch
points of multiplicity $3$. Now, $g$ is of order $4$ and hence has a
pole of order $4$ at $z=0$, and of course has zeros of order $1$ at
the branch points. It follows that we have a canonical divisor $K =
4Q$ since $df/g^2$ has a single zero of order $4$ at the point $z=0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{6}

\subprob{i}

Let $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ be a basis of $S$. Since
\[
\textstyle{\ord_P(\sum a_if_i) \ge \min_i \ord_P(f_i)}
\]
we have $a_P = - \min_i \ord_P(f_i)$. Since there are finitely many
$f_i$ and each has a finite set of poles and zeros (as a discrete
closed subset of the compact space $X$), each $a_P$ is finite and
vanishes outside a finite set.

\subprob{ii}

We first claim that for $P$ such that $a_P \ne 0$ and generic $g \in
S$, we have $\ord_P(g) = -a_P$. Indeed, if we let $z$ be a local
coordinate vanishing at $P$ then by definition of $a_P$ we get a
well-defined linear functional $\phi \c S \to \C$ by $g \mapsto
(z^{a_P}g)(P)$. Then $\phi(g) = 0$ precisely if $\ord_P(g) >
-a_P$. Thus $\phi$ is nonzero, and hence $\ker(\phi) \subset S$ has
codimension 1, proving the claim.

Now fix $f \in S$ nonzero. We next claim that generic $g \in S$ shares
no zeroes with $f$ outside the support of $D$. The set of $g$ which
share a given zero $P$ are obviously a vector subspace of $S$, and if
this were the entirety of $S$, then we would have $a_P \ne 0$, which
we assumed was not the case. Since $f$ has finitely many zeros, this
proves the claim.

Finally, fix generic $g \in S$ satisfying the properties of the two
claims above. Then for all $P$ in the support of $D$ we have
$\ord_P(g) = -a_P \le \ord_P(f)$, so $f/g$ has no pole at $P$. Note by
definition of $a_P$ all poles of $f$ must be in the support of $D$, so
since $g$ shares no zeros with $f$, the number of poles of $f/g$ must
precisely be the number of zeros of $g$ outside the support of
$D$. But again, $g$ can have no poles outside the support of $D$, so
since $(g)$ must have degree $0$, this number of zeros must be minus
the degree of $(g)$ restricted to the support of $D$. By our
hypothesis on $g$, this is $\deg(D)$, as desired.
