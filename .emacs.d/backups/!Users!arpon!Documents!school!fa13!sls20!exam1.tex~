\section{Motivation}

Recall that in a category $\C$ we have a \textit{hom-set}
$\Hom_\C(X,Y)$ for any two objects $X,Y \in \Ob \C$. But sometimes we
really want $\Hom_\C(X,Y)$ to be more than just a set, i.e. have the
structure of an object in some category. Our primary motivation is the
idea that some categories should have \textit{hom-spaces}.

\begin{example}
  Consider $\C = \Top$ the category of spaces. (Actually we'll need to
  restrict our class of spaces, but let's leave the details for a
  couple of pages.) We'll see that $\Hom_\C(X,Y)$ has a natural
  topology, which gives us a mapping \textit{space} $\Map(X,Y)$. An
  important property this satisfies---an incarnation of the
  ``hom-tensor adjunction''---is that there is a natural isomorphism
  \begin{equation}
    \label{homtensor}\tag{$\ast$}
    \Map(X \times Y, Z) \simeq \Map(X, \Map(Y, Z)).
  \end{equation}
  And one particularly important example of this important property is
  when $X = [0,1]$. Then (\ref{homtensor}) tells us that talking about
  \textit{homotopies} of maps $Y \to Z$ is equivalent to talking about
  \textit{paths} in $\Map(Y,Z)$.
\end{example}

\section{Monoidal and enriched categories}

So we want to somehow talk about categories $\C$ in which we have
hom-objects in some other category $\T$. It turns out the structure we
want on $\T$ is some sort of ``tensor product''. In fact it's easy to
see why we need some way of taking any two objects in $\T$ and
producing a third: we need a way to write down a composition law
$\Hom_\C(X,Y) \times \Hom_\C(Y,Z) \to \Hom_\C(X,\Z)$ as a map in $\T$!
But we'll use the notation $\otimes$ instead of $\times$.

\begin{definition}
  A \textit{monoidal category} $\T$ is a category equipped with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a functor $- \otimes - : \T \times \T \to \T$, the
    \textit{tensor product}
  \item an object $1 \in \T$, the \textit{unit}
  \item a natural isomorphism $\alpha : (- \otimes -) \otimes - \to -
    \otimes (- \otimes -)$, the \textit{associator}
  \item a natural isomorphism $\lambda : 1 \otimes - \to \id_\T$, the
    \textit{left unitor}
  \item a natural isomorphism $\rho : - \otimes 1 \to \id_\T$, the
    \textit{right unitor}
  \end{itemize}
  satisfying coherence conditions given by two commutative diagrams: the
    \textit{triangle identity},
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny]
      (- \otimes 1) \otimes - \ar{rr}{\alpha} \ar{dr}[below]{\rho
        \otimes \id_\T\hspace{30pt}} & \ & - \otimes (1 \otimes -)
      \ar{dl}{\id_\T \otimes \lambda} \\ \ & - \otimes -, & \
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    and the \textit{pentagon identity},
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny]
      \ & (- \otimes -) \otimes (- \otimes -) \ar{dr}{\alpha} \ \\ ((-
      \otimes -) \otimes -) \otimes - \ar{ur}{\alpha} \ar{d}{\alpha
        \otimes \id_\T} & \ & - \otimes (- \otimes (- \otimes -)) \\ (-
      \otimes (- \otimes -)) \otimes - \ar{rr}{\alpha} & \ & - \otimes
      ((- \otimes -) \otimes -) \ar{u}{\id_\T \otimes \alpha}.
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The coherence conditions look sort of intimidating. Basically the
  point is that the tensor product should behave as one might
  expect. Perhaps even more concretely, as the name suggests, a
  symmetric monoidal category is a categorification of the notion of a
  commutative monoid. So just think that the tensor product gives a
  nice, commutative, associative multiplication on $\T$.
\end{remark}

\renewcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}

\begin{examples}
  \label{examples-monoidal}
  One thing to note immediately is that we can put different monoidal
  structures on the same category. We have the following familiar
  examples.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\T := \Set$ the category of sets; $\otimes := \times$ the
    direct product; $1 := \{*\}$ the one-point set.
  \item $\T := \Set$ the category of sets; $\otimes := \amalg$ the
    disjoint union; $1 := \emptyset$ the empty set.
  \item $\T := \Ab$ the category of abelian groups; $\otimes :=
    \otimes_\Z$ the tensor product over $\Z$; $1 := \Z$.
  \item $\T := \Ab$ the category of abelian groups; $\otimes :=
    \oplus$ the direct sum; $1 := 0$ the trivial group.
  \item If you're feeling fancy, $\T := \Ch$ the category of chain
    complexes; $\otimes := \otimes_\Z$ the tensor product of complexes
    over $\Z$, $1 := \Z$ the complex with $\Z$ concentrated in degree
    $0$.
  \item Most relevant to our immediate goals, $\T := \Top$ the
    category of topological spaces; $\otimes := \times$ the direct
    product; $1 := \{*\}$ the one-point space.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

Now we want to define precisely what it means for a category to have
hom-objects in a monoidal category.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\T$ be a monoidal category. Then a \textit{$\T$-enriched
    category} (or a \textit{category enriched over $\T$}) $\C$ is the
  data of
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a collection $\Ob\C$ of \textit{objects}
  \item a \textit{hom-object} $\Hom_\C(X,Y) \in \Ob\T$ for all pairs
    $X,Y \in \Ob\C$
  \item a \textit{composition} map (in the category $\T$!)
    \[
    \circ : \Hom_\C(Y,Z) \otimes \Hom(X,Y) \to \Hom(X,Z)
    \]
    for all triples of objects $X,Y,Z \in \Ob\C$
  \item an \textit{identity} $\id_X : 1 \to \Hom_\C(X,X)$ for all
    objects $X \in \C$
  \end{itemize}
  satisfying
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the commutative diagram for associativity for $W,X,Y,Z \in \Ob
    \C$,
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      (\Hom_\C(Z,Y) \otimes \Hom_\C(X,Y)) \otimes \Hom_\C(W,X)
      \rar{\circ \otimes \id} \ar{dd}{\alpha} & \Hom_\C(X,Z) \otimes
      \Hom_\C(W,X) \dar{\circ} \\ \ & \Hom_\C(W,Z) \\ \Hom_\C(Z,Y)
      \otimes (\Hom_\C(X,Y) \otimes \Hom_\C(W,X)) \rar{\id \otimes
        \circ} & \Hom_\C(Z,Y) \otimes \Hom_\C(W,Y)
      \ar{u}[right]{\circ}
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
  \item the commutative diagrams for the identity maps for $X,Y \in
    \Ob\C$,
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny]
      1 \otimes \Hom_\C(X,Y) \ar{rr}{\id_Y \otimes \id}
      \ar{dr}[below]{\lambda\hspace{10pt}} & \ & \Hom_\C(Y,Y) \otimes
      \Hom_\C(X,Y) \ar{dl}{\circ} \\ \ & \Hom_\C(X,Y), & \
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    and
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep = tiny]
      \Hom_\C(X,Y) \otimes 1 \ar{rr}{\id \otimes \id_X}
      \ar{dr}[below]{\rho\hspace{10pt}} & \ & \Hom_\C(X,Y) \otimes
      \Hom_\C(X,X) \ar{dl}{\circ} \\ \ & \Hom_\C(X,Y). & \
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{examples}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Any ordinary category is a $\Set$-enriched category when we
    put a monoidal structure on $\Set$ as in Example
    \ref{examples-monoidal}.1.
  \item $\Set$, $\Ab$, and $\Ch$ are all enriched over themselves.
  \item When we say a category has \textit{hom-spaces} we mean mean
    the category is be enriched over $\Top$, given the monoidal
    structure in Example \ref{examples-monoidal}.6.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

\section{The categories $\CGHaus$ and $\Top$}

Now we have the language to investigate the construction of hom-spaces
between topological spaces.

\begin{definition}
  Let $X,Y$ spaces. The \textit{compact-open topology} on
  $\Hom_\Top(X,Y)$ is defined as having subbasis elements of the form
\end{definition}

Today we're interested in $\T = \Top$, $\otimes = \times$, and $1 =
\{*\}$. And we're going to enrich $\CGHaus$ compactly
generatedHausdorff spaces with $\T$. We're interested in these spaces
because we needs some conditions to get $\Map(X,Y) \times \Map(Y,Z)
\to \Map(X,Z)$ to be continuous (i.e., a map in the category
$\Top$). There's an article on nLab about ``Convenient categories of
topological spaces'' that deals with this.

But we jumped the gun. We need to define a topology on
$\Map(X,Y)$. We'll define a subbasis for the compact-open topology:
sets $(K,U)$ of maps $X \to Y$ which send $K \to Y$, where $K
\subseteq X$ compact and $U \subseteq Y$ open.

We claim that the following identity holds:
\[
\Map(A \times B, C) \simeq \Map(A, \Map(B,C)).
\]
Where $f \mapsto g$ where $g(a)(b) = f(a,b)$.

For continuity in forward direction, suffices to show $(K,(L,U))
\subseteq \Map(A, \Map(B,C))$ has open preimage (this is a
lemma). But preimage is just $(K \times L, U)$ so clear. The other
direciton is harder, and you probably need to use the compactly
generated Hasudorff condition. Break $K$ into compact boxes $K_i
\times L_j$ and then do shit. ``We're in the thick jungle of point-set
topology.''

Important example $A = [0,1]$. This tells us homotopies are paths in
the mapping space.
