Cook:
3. 5/5 - thank you for explicitly
   stating where the char 0 assumption
   is used!
5. 10/10

Fan:
3. 5/5 - note we usually call it the
   *degree*, not the order. also be sure
   you understand that you used the char
   0 assumption when you assume g' is
   nonzero.
5. 10/10

Palmer:
3. 5/5 - note that you used the char 0
   hypothesis to say g does not divide
   g' (in char p you might have g' = 0!)
5. 10/10

Ward:
3. 5/5 - nice!
5. 10/10 - note you don't have to use
   the hammer of the degree of the
   cyclotomic polynomial, you determined
   which roots have degree 2 on the
   previous homework!
