\section*{Opening nonsense}

I've recently learned a bit about the general framework of model
categories. It's sort of amazing, in the sense that seemingly a lot of
the basic homotopy theory of spaces which I've seen can be axiomatised
in a totally formal and categorical way. This includes something like
Whitehead's theorem (and its converse)---that a map of CW complexes is
a homotopy equivalence if and only if it's a weak homotopy
equivalence---which I never would have thought of as a categorical
fact.

Anyway, this axiomatisation and generalisation is beautiful and all,
but of course one hopes that it leads to new homotopy theory, in
addition to providing a nice framework for existing homotopy theory to
live in. Obviously it did. My goal in writing these notes was to learn
about one of the earliest examples of this, the development of a
(co)homology theory of commutative algebras by Andr\'{e}
\cite{andre-cotangent} and Quillen \cite{quillen-cotangent}.

\section{Simplicial model categories}

Our first step will be to give the category of simplicial commutative
algebras over a ring $R$ the structure of a simplicial model
category. We will do this much more generally, following
\cite[Ch. II]{goerssjardine}.
