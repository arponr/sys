9.4. 10/10 - i guess your two methods in a/b aren't all that
     different... note that, e.g., in \F_3 you know all the
     irreducible quadratics, and you can use this to check no
     quadratics divide your quartic
9.11. 10/10
10.1. 5/5
10.3. 5/5
10.5. 10/10
10.8. 5/5 - note it's pretty straightforward to prove more generally
      that Gal(\Q(\zeta_n)/\Q) is isomorphic to the multiplicative
      group (\Z/n)^*
