        <p>This is a post about some numbers that I saw at work one
          day during my internship at Google. I present them to you
          without further ado.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>21:</strong> I got to run a job with 21
            terabytes of input. <em>Tera</em>. And that's
            compressed.</li>
          <li><strong>10000000000:</strong> 21 TB means I got to
            compute statistics on data sets of size greater than 10
            billion. <em>Billion</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>3:</strong> It took fewer than 3 hours to run
            that job. I love MapReduce and resources.</li>
          <li><strong>23:</strong> Later on, after realising I had
            made some stupid mistakes, I needed to run that job again
            (and because it felt so damn cool the first time, and I
            could, so why not). Anyway it turns out the data was on
            some machines on the East Coast, and the job was running
            on machines on the West Coast. That's efficiency. Well so
            I (and, by &quot;I&quot;, I mean someone else on my team
            who actually knew what he was doing) managed to get the
            job running next door to the data. And for ten minutes or
            so, that 21 TB was being sent to the job at more than 23
            gigbatyes per second. <em>Giga</em>. Holy bandwidth,
            batman.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So it turns out working at Google indeed has perks. Those
          numbers are all due to some really smart people that work
          (or have worked) here. That's nice to think about. It's even
          nicer to stop thinking about that, look at those numbers,
          and just feel dope as hell, if only for a moment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps two moments, though. A new number arrived the
          following day.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>30:</strong> After tweaking some things, the job
            ran in less than 30 minutes. That's some astounding
            stuff.</li>
        </ul>
