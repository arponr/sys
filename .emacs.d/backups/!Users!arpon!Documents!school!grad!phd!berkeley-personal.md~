Of course it would also be a real privilege to learn homotopy theory
from experts like Professors Teleman, Teichner, and Nadler, and more
generally just discuss mathematics with the department's phenomenal
faculty. Finally, the MSRI seems to be a veritable hotbed for
cutting-edge mathematics, especially in the areas I am fascinated by;
it would be a unique and unbelievably valuable experience to grow as a
student in such an environment.
