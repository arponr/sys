\section{Application of Baire category}

\begin{remark}
  I thought this one was pretty difficult! So I asked Alex for
  help. Then Alex pointed me to a blog
  post\footnote{\url{terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/covering-a-non-closed-interval-by-disjoint-closed-intervals}}
  by Terence Tao on this (well, a \textit{very} similar) problem,
  where he writes ``I was not able to answer the question
  immediately...'', which made me feel a bit better. (But not that
  much better, since it was fairly clear from context that one should
  apply Baire category, and I just couldn't figure out how...) Anyway,
  the point is my solution here pretty much came from that post.
\end{remark}

Suppose $[0,1] = \bigcup_{j \in \N} [a_j,b_j]$. Let $F_i \coloneqq
\{a_j,b_j \mid 1 \le j \le i\}$ for $i \in \N$, and let $F \coloneqq
\bigcup_{i \in \N} F_i$. Then since the $[a_j,b_j]$ are disjoint,
\[
[0,1] - F = \bigcup_{j \in \N} [a_j,b_j] - \bigcup_{j \in
  \N}\{a_j,b_j\} = \bigcup_{j \in \N} (a_j,b_j)
\]
is open, so $F$ is closed in $[0,1]$. Since $[0,1]$ is complete, this
implies $F$ is complete. But then by the Baire category theorem (or
rather, Corollary 6.12 on p. 40 of the course notes), $F_i$ must have
nonempty interior for some $i \in \N$. Of course this is a
contradiction.

\section{$G_\delta$ sets}

\subsection{Metric closeds}

Let $(X,d)$ a metric space and $A \subseteq X$. Define $d(x,A)
\coloneqq \inf_{a \in A} d(x,a)$ for $x \in X$, and $B(A,r) \coloneqq
\{x \in X \mid d(x,A) < r\}$ for $r > 0$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{set-dist-zero}
  For $x \in X$, $x \in \oline A \iff d(x,A) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By definition of $\inf$, we have $d(x,A) = 0$ if and only if for
  each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $a \in A$ such that $d(x,a) <
  \epsilon$. But this is precisely what it means to say $x \in \oline
  A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{set-dist-cont}
  The map $X \to \R$ sending $x \mapsto d(x,A)$ is continuous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show that
  \[
  \{x \in X \mid d(x,A) < r\} \quad\text{and}\quad \{x \in X \mid
  d(x,A) > r\}
  \]
  are open for $r > 0$. We will show the former, which is just
  $B(A,r)$, is open; the argument for the latter is analogous. If $x
  \in B(A,r)$. Then by definition of $\inf$ there must exist $a \in A$
  such that $d(x,a) < r$. Let $r' \coloneqq r - d(x,a) > 0$. Then for
  any $y \in B(x,r'/2)$ we have by the triangle inequality that
  \[
  d(y,A) \le d(y,a) \le d(y,x) + d(x,a) \le r'/2 + d(x,a) < r.
  \]
  Therefore $B(x,r'/2) \subseteq B(A,r)$, whence $B(A,r)$ is open.
\end{proof}

The lemmas reduce (a) to (b), which we now prove.

\subsection{Continuous zero locus}

Let $I_k \coloneqq (-1/k,1/k) \subseteq \R$, which is open, for $k \in
\N$. Then
\[
\textstyle{\{0\} = \bigcap_{k \in \N} I_k \implies Z = f^{-1}(0) =
  \bigcap_{k \in \N} f^{-1}(I_k)},
\]
so $Z$ is a $G_\delta$ since $f^{-1}(I_k)$ is open in $X$ by
continuity of $f$.

\subsection{Points in $2^\R$}

Let $\{U_k\}_{k \in \N}$ any countable collection of opens in $2^\R$,
and suppose $U \coloneqq \bigcap_{k \in \N} U_k$ is nonempty. Let $p
\in U$. From the basis of the product topology we see that for $k \in
\N$ there exists a finite set $E_k \subseteq \R$ such that $U_k
\supseteq \prod_{x \in \R} V_{k,x} \ni p$, where $V_{k,x} = 2$ for all
$x \notin E_k$. Let $E \coloneqq \bigcup_{k \in \N} E_k$. Then clearly
$U \supseteq \prod_{x \in \R} V_x$, where $V_x = 2$ for all $x \notin
E$. But $E$ is countable union of finite sets, hence countable. Since
$\R$ is uncountable, $U$ must contain more than one point.

\section{Arzela-Ascoli examples}

\renewcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}

\subsection*{(a)}

The canonical counterexample here: for $n \in \N$ let $f_n \in \F$ be
given by $f_n(x) \coloneqq x^n$. Since $f_n(x) \to 0$ for $x \in
[0,1)$ and $f_n(1) \to 1$, no subsequence of $(f_n)$ can converge in
  $C([0,1])$. Thus $\F$ is not compact.

\subsection*{(b)}

Let $\F_1 \coloneqq \{f \in \F \mid |f(x) - f(y)| \le
|x-y|^{1/2}\text{ for }x,y \in [0,1]\}$. For $\epsilon > 0$ we have
$|x-y| < \epsilon^2 \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$ for all $f \in
\F_1$, so $\F_1$ is equicontinuous. Then to show $\F_1$ is compact, by
Arzela-Ascoli it suffices to show $\F_1$ is closed. Suppose $(f_k) \in
\F_1^\N$ converges to $f \in C([0,1])$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. By
definition of the metric on $C([0,1])$, there is some $k \in \N$ such
that $|f(x) - f_k(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in [0,1]$. By the
triangle inequality it follows that
\[
|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f_k(x)| + |f_k(x) - f_k(y)| + |f_k(y) -
f(y)| \le |x-y|^{1/2} + 2\epsilon
\]
for all $x,y \in [0,1]$. Since $\epsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, it
follows that $f \in \F_1$, and hence that $\F_1$ is closed.

\subsection*{(c)}

Let $\F_2 \coloneqq \{f \in \F \mid \sup_{x \ne y} |f(x) - f(y)|/|x-y|
< \infty\}$. The canonical counterexample returns! Indeed, for $n \in
\N$ let $f_n(x) := x^n$ as in (a); then we have
\[
\frac{|f_n(x) - f_n(y)|}{|x-y|} = \left|\frac{x^n-y^n}{x-y}\right| =
\left|\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^ky^{n-1-k}\right| \le \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}
|x^ky^{n-1-k}| \le n
\]
for $x, y \in [0,1]$ distinct, so $f_n \in \F_2$. Then the argument in
(a) gives that $\F_2$ is also not compact.

\subsection*{(d)}

\section{Explicitly separating metric closeds}

Define $f : X \to \R$ by
\[
f(x) \coloneqq \frac{d(x,B)}{d(x,A) + d(x,B)}.
\]
Since $A,B$ are closed, by Lemma \ref{set-dist-zero} we have $d(x,A) =
0 \iff x \in A$ and $d(x,B) = 0 \iff x \in B$ for $x \in X$. It
follows by disjointness of $A,B$ that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d(x,A) + d(x,B) > 0$ for all $x \in X$;
\item $f|_A = 1$ and $f|_B = 0$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover by Lemma \ref{set-dist-cont} $f$ is continuous.

\section{A topological Nullstellensatz}

\begin{remark}
  Prof. McMullen's update to the problem allowing you to assume $\phi$
  is $\R$-linear was in response to some confusion on my part about
  this. But he also showed me this neat trick to see that $\phi$ is
  automatically $\R$-linear given the original assumptions.

  For $a \in \R$ we also denote by $a$ the constant function $K \to
  \R$ with value $a$. Then for $f \in C(K)$ we have $\phi(af) =
  \phi(a)\phi(f)$, so to show $\R$-linearity it suffices to show
  $\phi(a) = a$. By hypothesis $\phi(1) = 1$, and from $\phi(f+g) =
  \phi(f)+\phi(g)$ it follows that $\phi(a) = a$ for $a \in \Z$. Then
  from $\phi(fg) = \phi(f)\phi(g)$ it follows that $\phi(a) = a$ for
  $a \in \Q$. Now---here's the cool part---for $a \ge 0$ we have
  $\phi(a) = \phi(\sqrt{a})^2 \ge 0$, so it follows that if $a_2 \ge
  a_1$ in $\R$ then
  \[
  a_2 - a_1 \ge 0 \implies \phi(a_2) - \phi(a_1) = \phi(a_2 - a_1) \ge
  0,
  \]
  i.e., $\phi$ is order-preserving. But it's easy to see that we must
  then have $\phi(a) = a$ for all $a \in \R$!
\end{remark}

Ok, now the actual problem. Let $M \coloneqq \{f \in C(K) \mid \phi(f)
= 0\}$. For $f \in C(K)$ let $U_f \coloneqq f^{-1}(\R - \{0\})$, which
is open in $K$. We claim there exists $x \in K$ such that $f(x) = 0$
for all $f \in M$. If not, then $\bigcup_{f \in M} U_f = K$, so by
compactness there exist $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in M$ such that $\bigcup_{f
  \in M} U_{f_i} = K$. That is, for all $x \in K$ there exists some $1
\le i \le n$ such that $f_i(x) \ne 0$. Then if we define $g \coloneqq
\sum_{i=1}^n f_i^2$, we get that $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \in K$, and
hence $1/g \in C(K)$. But then using our hypotheses on $\phi$ and that
$\phi(f_i) = 0$ for all $1 \le i \le n$,
\[
\phi(1) = \phi(1/g \cdot g) = \phi(1/g)\phi(g) =
\phi(1/g)\sum_{i=1}^n\phi(f_i)^2 = 0,
\]
contradicting that $\phi(1) = 1$. Thus there exists $x \in K$ such
that $f(x) = 0$ for all $f \in M$. Then for any $f \in C(K)$, we have
by $\R$-linearity that
\begin{align*}
\phi(f-\phi(f)) = \phi(f) - \phi(f) = 0 &\implies f - \phi(f) \in M
\\ &\implies (f-\phi(f))(x) = 0 \implies f(x) = \phi(f).
\end{align*}

We now just have to show uniqueness of $x$. Let $y \in K - \{x\}$. It
suffices to show there exists $f \in C(K)$ such that $f(x) \ne
f(y)$. But since $\{x\},\{y\}$ are closed in $K$, and $K$ is compact
Hausdorff and hence normal, this is immediate from Urysohn's lemma.

\newcommand{\m}{\mathfrak{m}}

\begin{remark}
  (For those interested in algebra.) Why did I call this a topological
  Nullstellensatz? Well, $C(K)$ is a commutative ring. For each $x \in
  K$ we have a ring morphism given by evaluation,
  \[
  \ev_x : C(K) \to \R, \quad f \mapsto f(x);
  \]
  then $\m_x \coloneqq \ker(\ev_x)$ is a maximal ideal in $C(K)$, since
  clearly $C(K)/\m_x \simeq \R$. The point is these are \textit{all}
  the maximal ideals of $C(K)$.

  Indeed, let $\m$ any maximal ideal in $C(K)$. By the argument given
  above, there must exist $x \in K$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $f
  \in \m$. But then $\m \subseteq \m_x$, so by maximality $\m =
  \m_x$. Finally the uniqueness statement says that in fact $x \mapsto
  \m_x$ is a \textit{bijection} between the points of $x$ and the
  maximal ideals of $C(K)$.
\end{remark}

\section{A weird compact space}

Recall $\beta(\N) \coloneqq [0,1]^C$ where $C \coloneqq [0,1]^\N$ is
the set of all sequences in $[0,1]$. And recall (or see problem 7!) we
have an embedding $\iota : \N \to \beta(\N)$, such that $\iota(n)_f =
f_n$ for $f \in C$.

Suppose $(\iota(n))_{n \in \N} \in \beta(\N)^\N$ had a convergent
subsequence $(\iota(n_k))_{k \in \N}$. Since $\beta(\N)$ is in the
product topology, the projection $\pi_f : \beta(\N) \to [0,1]$ is
continuous for $f \in C$. It follows that for $f \in C$, the sequence
\[
(\pi_f(\iota(n_k)))_{k \in \N} = (\iota(n_k)_f)_{k \in \N} =
(f_{n_k})_{k \in \N}
\]
is convergent. But this obviously cannot hold for all $f \in
C$---e.g., we can consider $f$ with $f_{n_k} \coloneqq 0$ for $k$ even
and $f_{n_k} \coloneqq 1$ for $k$ odd. Thus we have a contradiction.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The Stone-\v{C}ech compactification}

\begin{remark}
  This is the same argument we used when proving the Urysohn
  metrisation theorem. We need to prove that $\iota$ is continuous,
  injective, and open.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Continuity}

For $f \in C$, let $\pi_f : [0,1]^C \to [0,1]$ the projection onto the
factor indexed by $f$; by definition we have $\pi_f \circ \iota = f$
is continuous. Thus $\iota$ is continuous by definition of the product
topology.

\subsection{Injectivity}

Let $x,y \in X$ distinct. By Urysohn's lemma we can find $f \in C$
such that
\[
\iota(x)_f = f(x) = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \iota(y)_f = f(y) = 1.
\]
Thus $\iota(x) \ne \iota(y)$, so $\iota$ is injective.

\subsection{Openness}

Let $U \subseteq X$ open. By definition of the subspace topology, to
show $\iota(U)$ is open it suffices to find for each $x \in U$ a
neighbourhood $\iota(x) \in V \subseteq [0,1]^C$ such that $V \cap
\im(\iota) \subseteq \iota(U)$. So fix any $x \in U$. By Urysohn's
lemma there exists $f \in C$ such that $f(x) = 0$ and $f|_{X - U} =
1$. Now let $V \coloneqq \{x \in [0,1]^C \mid x_f < 1/2\}$, which is
evidently a basis element of the product topology and hence
open. Certainly $\iota(x) \in V$, and clearly if $y \in X - U$ then
$\iota(y) \notin V$. So indeed $V$ is as desired.
