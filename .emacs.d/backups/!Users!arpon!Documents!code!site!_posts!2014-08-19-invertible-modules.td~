-- Notation: Let $A$ be a commutative ring.

-- Lemma #trivial-point-to-open: Let $M$ be a finitely generated
   $A$-module. If $M_\p \iso 0$ for some $\p \in \Spec(A)$, then $M_f
   \iso 0$ for some $f \in A - \p$.

   -- Proof: Choose generators $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in M$. If $M_\p \iso
      0$ then there are $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in A - \p$ such that $f_ix_i
      = 0$ for $1 \le i \le n$. Taking $f \ce \prod_{i=1}^n f_i \in
      A - \p$, we have $fM \iso 0 \implies M_f \iso 0$.

-- Lemma #locally-free-point-to-open: Let $M$ be a finitely generated
   $A$-module. Then $M$ is locally free of finite rank if and only if
   $M_\p$ is a finite free $A_\p$-module for each $\p \in \Spec(A)$.

   -- Proof: The only if direction is obvious, so assume $M_\p$ is a
      finite free $A_\p$-module for each $\p \in \Spec(A)$. Fixing $\p
      \in \Spec(A)$, it suffices to show there exists $f \in A - \p$
      such that $M_f$ is a free $A_f$-module. We have an isomorphism
      $A_\p^n \iso M_\p$, which without loss of generality is the
      localisation of a morphism $\alpha \c A^n \to M$. It follows
      from #trivial-point-to-open that since $\alpha_\p$ is an
      isomorphim, so is $\alpha_f$ for some $f \in A - \p$.

-- Definition: We say an $A$-module $M$ is *invertible* if there
   exists an $A$-module $N$ and an isomorphism $M \otimes_A N \iso A$.

-- Lemma #invertible-module-finitely-generated: An invertible
   $A$-module $M$ is finitely generated.

   -- Proof: Assume we have an $A$-module $N$ and an isomorphism
      $\alpha \c A \iso M \otimes_A N$. Observe the image of $\alpha$
      must be generated by a single element of $M \otimes_A N$, so
      $\alpha$ must factor through an isomorphism $\beta \c A \iso M_0
      \otimes_A N$ for some finitely generated submodule $M_0
      \subseteq M$. Then we have an isomorphism

      $$
      \begin{xy}
      \xymatrix{
        M \ar[d]^{\sim} \ar[r]^{\sim} &
        M_0 \ar[d]_{\sim} \\
        M \otimes_A A \ar[d]^{\sim}_{\id \otimes \beta} &
        A \otimes_A M_0 \ar[d]_{\sim}^{\alpha \otimes \id} \\
        M \otimes_A M_0 \otimes_A N \ar[r]^{\sim} &
        M \otimes_A N \otimes_A M_0,
      }
      \end{xy}
     $$

     implying $M$ is finitely generated.

-- Lemma #invertible-locally-free: An $A$-module $M$ is invertible if
   and only if $M$ is locally free of rank $1$.

   -- Proof: First assume $M$ is invertible: there is an $A$-module
      $N$ such that $M \otimes_A N \iso A$. Fix any $\p \in
      \Spec(A)$. By #locally-free-point-to-open it suffices to show
      $M_\p$ is free of rank $1$ over $A_\p$. We have

      $$
      M_\p \otimes_{A_\p} N_\p \iso (M \otimes N)_\p \iso A_\p,
      $$

      i.e. $M_\p$ is invertible. Thus we are reduced to the case that
      $A$ is a local ring. Let $\m \in \Spec(A)$ denote the maximal
      ideal and $k \ce A/\m$ the residue field. We have

      $$
      (M \otimes_A k) \otimes_k (N \otimes_A k) \iso M \otimes_A N
      \otimes_A k \iso k,
      $$
      
      i.e. $M \otimes_A k$ is an invertible $k$-module. But $k$ is a
      field so obviously this implies $M/\m M \iso M \otimes_A k \iso
      k$. Let $x \in M$ be a lift of a generator of $M/\m M$ and
      $\alpha \c A \to M$ the map defined by $1 \mapsto x$. By
      construction the induced map $\alpha \otimes k \c k \to M
      \otimes_A k$ is an isomorphism.  Then Nakayama's lemma implies
      $\alpha$ is an isomorphism.

      Conversely, assume $M$ is locally free of rank $1$. Let $M^\vee
      \ce \hom_A(M, A)$ denote the dual of $M$ and consider the
      canonical evaluation map $M \otimes_A M^\vee \to A$. By
      hypothesis this morphism locally looks like evaluation $A
      \otimes_A A^\vee \to A$, which is clearly an
      isomorphism.[^locfree-fp] This finishes the proof.

-- Definition: It follows from #invertible-module-finitely-generated
   that the collection $\Pic(A)$ of isomorphism classes of invertible
   modules forms a set. Under tensor product $\Pic(A)$ forms an
   abelian group called the *Picard group* of $A$. Note that by the
   proof of #invertible-locally-free the inverse in $\Pic(A)$ of (the
   isomorphism class) of an invertible module $L$ is given by (the
   isomorphism class of) the dual $L^\vee$.

-- Lemma #graded-ring-invertible-components: Let $A_*$ be a graded
   ring. Let $\otimes$ denote $\otimes_{A_0}$. Assume there is an
   isomorphism of $A_0$-modules $A_1 \otimes A_{-1} \iso A_0$. Then
   for $n \ge 1$ we have

   $$
   A_n \iso A_1^{\otimes n} \quad\text{and}\quad
   A_{-n} \iso A_{-1}^{\otimes n} \iso (A_1^\vee)^{\otimes n}.
   $$

   -- Proof: We prove the first isomorphism by induction; the second
      is symmetric. The case $n=1$ is tautological. Let $n >
      1$. Multiplication gives a map $A_1^{\otimes n} \to A_n$. An
      inverse map is given by

      $$
      A_n \iso A_n \otimes A_0 \iso A_n \otimes A_{-1} \otimes A_1 \to
      A_{n-1} \otimes A_1 \iso A_1^{\otimes n},
      $$

      the last isomorphism coming from the inductive hypothesis.


[^locfree-fp]:
    I'm using here that locally free implies finitely presented, which
    implies that dualising will commute with localisation.
