circumstance of american economy

  dominant characteristic of economic growth in recent united states
  is mediocrity

  low growth fueled by debt, enabled by credit, made possibly by
  accomodating monetary policy

  relies on stimulus to demand rather than on breakthroughs in
  constraints on supply

  this is possible without institutional reconstruction, whereas real
  growth requires this

  vast increase in inequality in all dimensions, including wealth,
  income, wages

  richest guy (buffet) in u.s.: "there's a class war in the united
  states and my [the rich] class is winning", along with second
  richest guy: campaign for high tax on hereditary wealth

  immense dynamism and vitality still in the american economy,
  embodied in a network of vanguard of advanced sector, not just high
  technology sector, but even in manufacturing, services, and
  agriculture there is experimentalism. but this vanguardism is not
  rapidly spreading through national economy, excluding vast majority
  of labour force

  this economy also characterised by asset bubbles, periodic bursts

shape of the public conversation in the united states about economy

  dominant is neoliberal position (taken by non neoliberals and non
  conservatives, rather the default position):

    the way to insure economic growth is to guarantee the integrity of
    the institituions (property, contract) of the market economy,
    against attempts of politics to subvert the market economy

  this position has already demonstrated its incapable of changing the
  circumstances outlined above, and denies many people economic and
  educational welfare

  the alternative is the pseudo-progressive position

      major element: the strategy of economic growth is "easy money",
      controlled by central bank, not by government.

      an acommodating monetary policy is a blunt instrument, it
      doesn't necessarily make people spend or companies invest or
      banks lend (rather the actors just sit on their money)
