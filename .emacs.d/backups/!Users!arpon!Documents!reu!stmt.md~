Personal Statement
==================

At the moment my foremost interest and passion is mathematics, and it
seems that this will be the case for the forseeable future. I can't
say this has always been true, however. Indeed, I owe a great deal to
Harvard's unique and incredible department of mathematics. I don't
believe there are many other places on Earth where I could have become
so engrossed in and learned so much math in two and a half years.

Of course, I was not *uninterested* in math prior to enrolling at
Harvard. I was on my high school's math team and did fairly well in
local competitions, I took the AMC a couple of times, I participated
in ARML, etc. But I didn't even qualify for AIME, and didn't come
close to qualifying for the final rounds at ARML. Moreover, I didn't
have any strong desire to get there. I was doing math as a sort of
hobby, a social activity, but never felt motivated to study or
practice for these contests. I didn't know what *Art of Problem
Solving* was, and wasn't looking for it.

Not even three years have passed, but things have changed a great
deal. This semester I am taking second-semester graduate courses in
complex analysis, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry. In
addition, I am a course assistant for our second-semester
undergraduate algebra course, and am teaching somewhat younger kids
(8--10 year olds!) in the Math Circle a bit about graph theory. How
did I get here?

I think the invasion of math into my life began during the college
application process. While researching the honours math classes at the
University of Chicago, I discovered Spivak's *Calculus*. On and off
throughout my last year of high school I read this book, learning
about what was *actually* going on in my calculus class, and finding
the process of placing these intuitive ideas on rigorous foundations
quite fascinating. I ended up writing an expository paper about
Riemann and Darboux integration, and then decided to study
multivariable calculus and linear algebra that summer before coming to
Harvard.

So my interest in math was growing rapidly, but in just the first few
weeks at Harvard, rapid transformed into absolutely ridiculous. I
decided to give the infamous Math 55 a go at the start of the
semester. And well, I just kept going. I was mesmerised by all these
new mathematical structures---groups, rings, fields---and was
exhilarated learning from and collaborating with an incredible set of
classmates. In no time, I was spending 40 hours per week thinking
about math, and the Harvard math department had me for good.
