\section{$\pi_1$ as an unbased functor}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $X$ a space. Let $x,y \in X$ and $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ a path
  from $x$ to $y$. Then $[\eta] \mapsto $
\end{lemma}

\section{Contractibility of path space}

Let $P \coloneqq P_0(S^1)$. Let $c : P \to P$ the constant map at
$0$. To show $P$ is contractible it suffices to give a homotopy from
the identity $\id_P$ to $c$. Consider $F : P \times [0,1] \to P$
defined such that $F(\gamma,s) \in P$ is path defined by
$F(\gamma,s)(t) \coloneqq \gamma((1-t)s)$. Clearly $F(\gamma,0) =
\gamma$ and $F(\gamma,1) = c$ for all $\gamma \in P$, so we just need
to check $F$ is continuous. Everything in sight is a metric space
(we'll take the $\sup$-metric on the product $X \times [0,1]$) so we
can use $\epsilon$-$\delta$.

Let $(\gamma,s) \in X \times [0,1]$ and $\epsilon > 0$. This is going
to be a pain.

\begin{remark}
  This is the spaghetti slurping argument. Note that in fact one can
  define a certain topology on $P_0(X)$ for any space $X$, and this
  same argument---well, unless $X$ is a compact metric space,
  continuity will have to be checked in a different way---gives that
  any path space is contractible.

\section{Compact Hausdorff coverings}

\subsection{Proof}

Let $f : X \to Y$ a local homeomorphism of compact Hausdorff
spaces. Let $y \in Y$ and $F \coloneqq f^{-1}(y)$. Since $f$ is a
local homeomorphism, for each $x \in F$ we can choose $U_x$ an open
neighbourhood of $x$ such that $f|_{U_x}$ is an embedding. Note for
$x,x' \in F$ distinct, we must have $x' \notin U_x$; if not, we have
$f(x) = y = f(x')$, contradicting the injectivity of $f|_{U_x}$. It
follows in particular that the subspace topology on $F$ coincides with
the discrete topology.

Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, $\{y\}$ is closed in $Y$, and hence $F$ is
closed in $X$. Then since $X$ is compact this implies $F$ is
compact. But we know any compact discrete space must be finite, so we
can write $F = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ and $U_i \coloneqq U_{x_i}$ for
$1 \le i \le n$. Now since $X$ is Hausdorff we can assume without loss
of generality that the $U_i$ are disjoint (by replacing them with
smaller neighbourhoods). Then $A \coloneqq X - \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$ is
closed, and hence compact, in $X$; so $f(A)$ is compact, hence closed
(by Hausdorffness) in $Y$. Let $V \coloneqq \bigcap_{i=1}^n f(U_i) -
f(A)$, which is open of $y$ since $f(U_i)$ is open for $1 \le i \le n$
and $f(A)$ is closed.

By definition, $V$ is an open neighbourhood of $y$ and $f^{-1}(V)
\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$. Thus $f^{-1}(V) = \coprod_{i=1}^n
U'_i$ where $U'_i \coloneqq f^{-1}(V) \cap U_i$ for $1 \le i \le
n$. The $U_i'$ are clearly open, they are disjoint since the $U_i$
are, and since $f|_{U_i}$ is a homeomorphism onto $f(U_i)$, it is
immediate that $f|_{U'_i}$ is a homeomorphism onto $f(U'_i)$. Thus $V$
is an evenly covered neighbourhood of $y$.

\subsection{Counterexample}

Let $I \coloneqq (0, \pi) \subseteq \R$. Recall there is a
homeomorphism $\R \to I$, so it suffices to give a local homeomorphism
$I \to S^1$ which is not a covering. (Here we treat $S^1 \subseteq
\C$.) Consider $f : I \to S^1$ defined by $f(t) \coloneqq \exp(3it)$.
Clearly $f$ is a surjective local homeomorphism. But we claim that no
open neighbourhood of $-1 \in S^1$ is evenly covered, and hence $f$ is
not a covering. Indeed any open neighbourhood $V$ of $-1$ contains
some $s_1 = \exp(it_1)$ and $s_2 = \exp(it_2)$ with $0 < t_1 < \pi$
and $\pi < t_2 < 2\pi$. But then $f^{-1}(s_1)$ contains two points and
$f^{-1}(s_2)$ contains one point, so $U$ is evidently not evenly
covered.

\section{$\pi_1$ preserves products}

By definition of the product topology, giving continuous loops $[0,1]
\to X$ and $[0,1]$ to $Y$ based at $A \in X$ and $B \in Y$,
respectively, is equivalent to giving a continuous loop $[0,1] \to X
\times Y$ based at $(A,B)$. Similarly giving homotopies $[0,1] \times
[0,1] \to X$ and $[0,1] \times [0,1] \to Y$ between such loops is
equivalent to giving a homotopy $[0,1] \times [0,1] \to X \times Y$
between the resulting loops in $X \times Y$. This gives a bijection
$\pi_1(X,A) \times \pi_1(Y,B) \to \pi_1(X \times Y, (A,B))$. Since the
group operation on $\pi_1$ simply arises from composition of loops, it
is evident that the above bijection defines an isomorphism of groups.
