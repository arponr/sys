title: Personal Statement
---

I liked math in middle and high school, sure, but I certainly didn't
feel that it was or ever would be my vocation. For instance, the
American Mathematics Contest was for me simply a fun day during which
I realized math is hard, not something I ever wanted or even thought
to train for. But my time at Harvard has radically shifted my
perspective on mathematics: in place of the haphazard set of
computations and problem-solving techniques I saw before college, I
now see a language that reveals fundamental structures through
abstraction, and can express fascinating stories about these
structures. This has in turn completely transformed my relationship
with mathematics: over the past three years I have chosen to invest a
basically absurd portion of my time in understanding and teaching
mathematics, and I plan on sustaining this absurdity for the remainder
of my conscious hours.

In fact, I will be able to focus even more deeply on the subject
beginning next year with my graduate studies, which will not only be a
rewarding and stimulating experience in and of itself, but a crucial
step towards my long-term goal of being an professor of
mathematics. Of course, as a career, becoming a professor is really an
instrumental goal, but one which aligns extraordinarily well with my
end goals. Namely, I want to:

1. research what truly inspires me, helping to develop my and
   humanity's understanding of mathematics;
2. effectively motivate and guide others in their mathematical
   endeavors, in particular by teaching and communicating not only the
   rigorous formalism and details, but the intuition at the heart of
   mathematics, which unfortunately is elided all too often;
3. actively participate in the mathematical and greater scientific
   communities, in particular by engaging in, as well as developing
   tools for, worldwide collaboration.

Though it took longer to discover my love of mathematics, I have
thrived in curiosity-driven and research-like settings since high
school. From 2009--2011 I worked with Prof. Dilip Gersappe at Stony
Brook University, developing models for and simulating various
phenomena in materials science using a technique from computational
fluid dynamics known as the lattice Boltzmann method. This research
was certainly the most rewarding of my high school experiences, in
part because I learned a great deal from Prof. Gersappe about fluid
dynamics, modelling, and even the general process of theoretical
research; but perhaps even more because I was also given the freedom
to pursue and experiment with my own thoughts and ideas. This is
representative of my later mathematical pursuits too: I have felt most
fulfilled in more independent research-like environments, where I can
truly understand things and find inspiration by playing with and
exploring both my and my teachers' and peers' ideas.

The very first example of this lies at perhaps the root of my interest
in pure mathematics. At various times during my high school research I
found myself slightly dissatisfied: the models I was developing
produced qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable simulations, but
why? I had a sort of cartoon understanding of the lattice Boltzmann
method, but felt I must be missing a more precise, logical
understanding. I followed my curiosity and learned a bit of theory
about the Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics and how one
discretizes such a thing for computational models. I distinctly
remember finally understanding something about differential equations
on the back of a receipt during a materials science lecture, and just
jittering deliriously in my seat. Moments like this led to further
curiosity about pure mathematics, and after rummaging around the
internet a bit for advice on where to start, I discovered Spivak's
*Calculus*. I worked through the book on and off during my senior year
as a side project, hoping to more rigorously understand the concepts
appearing in my high school calculus class and my research. This
independent reading led to what someone very generous might call my
high school thesis, an exposition of the Riemann and Darboux
definitions of the integral.

The resources and opportunities at Harvard allowed me to transform
these loose strands of curiosity into an utter zeal for
mathematics. This began when I decided to give the infamous Math 55 a
go at the start of my first semester and, well, I just kept going. I
was exhilarated learning from and collaborating with an incredible set
of classmates. And in my first exposure to abstract algebra, I found
thinking about mathematics by understanding abstraction and structure
beautiful and inspiring, something I didn't manage to find in high
school classes and contests. Before I knew it, I was spending at least
thirty hours per week thinking about math (and probably another thirty
hours per week dreaming about it). The course inspired me to seriously
pursue mathematics, but it has been my subsequent independent work at
Harvard which has been most stimulating and most decisively shaped my
mathematical trajectory.

In the summer after my freshman year I stayed on campus to read about
the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras under the
supervision of Prof. Joe Harris. This project in particular gave me
the opportunity to learn and familiarize myself with the ubiquitous
language of general and differential topology, allowing me to take our
sequence of algebraic topology courses in my sophomore year. Since
then I have been engrossed in understanding the beautiful connections
forged by algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In my junior fall,
one of my friends and I decided to do an indepdendent reading course
on simplicial and abstract homotopy theory under the supervision of
Dr. Emily Riehl. This was easily one of our best decisions: being able
to work through the mathematics in free dialogue at a blackboard in a
small office was immensely more fun and instructive for me than almost
any lecture. During the course I learned that homotopy theory can be
understood as a rather general framework, not specific to the theory
of topological spaces, and incredibly even statements like Whithead's
theorem (that a weak equivalence of CW-complexes is a homotopy
equivalence) can fit into general categorical frameworks like the
theory of model categories. Fascinated by this beautiful abstraction,
I wrote a final paper on how the theory of model categories and
derived functors motivates one to transport singular homology to the
setting of commutative algebra, resulting in Andre-Quillen
homology. In the same semester I participated in an undergraduate
reading seminar centered on the theory of quasicategories, supervised
by Dr. Hiro Tanaka. This gave me the chance to give my first
somewhat-formal talk for a specifically mathematical audience, on the
proof and some applications of the Dold-Kan correspondence.

Most recently, I spent last summer learning about some amazing parts
of stable homotopy theory under the supervision of Prof. Jacob
Lurie. I focused on familarizing myself with spectra and the stable
homotopy category, and understanding some homotopy theory that arises
in the study of cobordism of manifolds, in Thom's classification of
unoriented manifolds up to cobordism and in an analagous result of
Quillen for the slight variant known as complex cobordism. The latter
computation leads to a miraculous connection between cohomology
theories and formal groups. Indeed the many miracles in this story
connecting topology, geometry, and algebra make it my favorite bit of
mathematics so far, and inspired me to continue working in this area
with Prof. Lurie for my senior thesis. This miraculous connection
allows us to associate a cohomology theory to any elliptic curve,
which we generally call elliptic cohomology. In my thesis I look to
make computations in equivariant versions of elliptic
cohomology. Currently I am reading about the theoretical backdrop of
these computations, e.g. the remarkable generalization by
Hill-Hopkins-Kuhn of character theory from the representation theory
of groups to certain equivariant cohomology theories, and Lurie's
fascinating work using derived algebraic geometry to define a version
of equivariant elliptic cohomology with nicer properties than the
naive Borel-equivariant theory. During my graduate work I hope to
continue researching these ideas, and learn about and discover other
stunning ways in which homotopy theory connects diverse fields and
objects of mathematics.

In addition to shaping my mathematical interests, these experiences
have distinctly influenced my philosophy of learning and teaching. I
believe that the key virtue of independent work is that it provides
the opportunity to get to grips with the core intuition of
mathematics, rather than simply face a barrage of meaningless
symbols. Unfortunately, it seems easy for teachers and lecturers to
tend to overlook these crucial bits of intuition in efforts to present
all of the rigorous details. I am committed to embodying this virtue
of intuition whenever I communicate mathematics, especially in
teaching. I have practiced this already as a course assistant for our
Topology I and Algebra II courses, holding office hours and teaching
section, and as an instructor in The Math Circle for the past three
semesters, teaching curious and excited 6--10 year olds. The latter
has been a particularly instructive experience, as these younger
students tend to respond *only* to intuitive, motivated ideas; guiding
them to intuitively discover fundamental mathematics, e.g. the
countability of the rational numbers, has been and continues to be an
incredibly fun challenge. Of course I hope I will continue practicing
and improving in implementing this philosophy throughout my graduate
studies and beyond. I believe that doing this, and motivating others
to do this, will allow me to be the most effective teacher of
mathematics, and more generally the most valuable member of the
mathematical and scientific community, that I can be.

As I mentioned earlier, another essential aspect of these experiences
has been the opportunity for free dialogue. Being able to talk through
mathematics with another person is incredibly useful, and of course in
general collaboration is a cornerstone of scientific
progress. Technology, specifically the internet, is already making
this sort of dialogue and collaboration more available and flexible;
the question-answer site MathOverflow is a great example for research
mathematics. But I believe there are even more tools to be developed
to aid worldwide mathematical communication. As a side project this
summer I began designing and programming an online messaging platform
which would support the particular needs of mathematical discussion. I
have many more ideas for this project, and hope that in time I can
create a tool useful for student-teacher communication (my original
motivation), professional collaboration, and probably many other
applications.

The NSF fellowship would allow me to optimally focus my energy during
my graduate studies, during which I hope to continue engaging in these
mathematical experiences which have so inspired my curiosity and
fervor, and work towards my aspiration of leading mathematics forward
as a creative researcher, effective teacher, and productive
collaborator.
