i feel like i'm at the centre of so many
crossroads, paradoxes...

the urge to be moral vs the
arbitrariness of the axioms. everything
comes down to some silly
physical/biological tendencies, which is
not satisfying at all; its objective,
but still arbitrary. yet i still feel
slightly depressed walking through the
tanger outlets, ironically light
tropical music playing, witnessing a
bunch of wealthy americans (like myself)
spend money on ridiculous crap, while
not giving a crap about the rest of the
world.

making things for myself (math) vs
making things for the world. related to
the first point - do i owe something to
humanity, morally? even though its just
some arbitrary event that i was born (a
joke played on me, according to childish
gambino). i feel like i should *want* to
do things for others. like a second
order want, when it should be a first
order.

trying to be really good at something vs
trying lots of things.

the dream of being alone vs the fear of
being alone. caring about others / being
cared about is such a burden. i feel so
uncomfortable doing certain things -
dancing, piano, singing, even watching
tv, probably writing - when others are
around. i dream of the cottage in
finland, next to a lake, like described
in colorless tsukuru tazaki. being alone
and finding something inside myself. but
then it seems that growth really happens
on collaborative adventures -
e.g. spencer of harmontown, the power of
the icarly gang's and avatar team's
relationships on me (the childhood thing
seems even more powerful somehow).

----------------------------------------

everybody is just playing games. they
try to understand their rules (axioms),
and play. conflict is
rule-contradiction; conflict resolution
is arbitrary, driven by society which is
driven by biology.

are we playing, or are we the pieces
being played? lack of
scale-invariance. cf. kafka's machine in
the penal colony.

This hotel is nestled in the heart of
me. Welcome.

Is this elevator going up or down?

- red pen
- you were a bitch but i didn't hate you
  for it, will you go out with me
- the email at max's
- better clothes, male model, tattoo
- everything i say will sound stupid, i
  love you
- plan to meet, jump

----------------------------------------

the horizon is right under my nose

----------------------------------------

stonehenge was indeed built by
aliens. like they immigrated to england
and built it and left.

----------------------------------------

the monotonous and insidious rhythms of
life (dfw's 'now did one now did one now
did one') v. the electric rhythms of
music

----------------------------------------

everything goes to shit when you try to
logic, try to *deduce* meaning. it is
rather emotions which allow you to
identify stable, meaningful values. this
feels weird and cool, doesn't it? this
is somehow connected to sleeping and
dreaming away the logical mazes you spin
yourself into at three in the
morning. the logicless dreams make more
sense then thinking. i want reality to
disintegrate into dreams whenever i
write about this shit.
