the horizon is right under my nose

stonehenge was indeed built by
aliens. like they immigrated to england
and built it and left.

the monotonous and insidious rhythms of
life (dfw's 'now did one now did one now
did one') v. the electric rhythms of
music

everything goes to shit when you try to
logic, try to *deduce* meaning. it is
rather emotions which allow you to
identify stable, meaningful values. this
feels weird and cool, doesn't it? this
is somehow connected to sleeping and
dreaming away the logical mazes you spin
yourself into at three in the
morning. the logicless dreams make more
sense then thinking. i want reality to
disintegrate into dreams whenever i
write about this shit.
