\subprob{a}

Let $\Q_p \inj K$ be any finite unramified extension, and $\F_p \inj
k$ the extension of residue fields. We have proven in lecture that for
$x \in \O_K$ we have $k = \F_p(\o x) \implies K = \Q_p(x)$. Now $k
\iso F_{p^r}$ for some $r \ge 1$, generated by some $(p^r - 1)$-st
root of unity. So we can choose $x \in \O_K$ such that $K = \Q_p(x)$
and $\o x^{p^r-1} = 1 \implies \o x^{p^r} = x$. Since $t^{p^r} - t$
has derivative $-1$ over $\F_p$, by Hensel's lemma we can choose $y
\in \O_K$ such that $y^{p^r} = y$ and $y - x \in \m_K$. This implies
$K = \Q_p(y)$ and $y \ne 0 \implies y^{p^r-1} = 1$.

So we have proven that $\Q_p^{\ur}$ is generated by the $(p^r-1)$-st
roots of unity for $r \ge 1$. Finally note for any $m > 1$ with
$(m,p)=1$ we have that $p^{\varphi(m)} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod m$, so the
$m$-th roots of unity are generated by the $(p^{\varphi(m)} - 1)$-st
roots of unity.

\subprob{b}

\begin{itemize}
\item Any $x \in \Q_p^\ur$ generates a finite unramified extension $L$
  of $K = \Q_p$. We know a uniformizer $\pi_K \in \O_K$ must also be a
  uniformizer in the unique extension of $v_p|_K$ to $L$, implying
  $\im(v_p|_L) = \im(v_p|_K)$. Since this holds for arbitrary $x$, it
  follows that
  \[
  \im(v_p|_{\Q_p^\ur}) = \im(v_p|_{\Q_p}) = \Z.
  \]
\item In a finite unramified extension $K \inj L$, the normalized
  valuation on $L$ extends the normalized valuation on $K$ so that we
  have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{p3-compatibility}
    \O_K = \O_L \cap K, \quad \m_K = \m_L \cap K.
  \end{equation}
  and by the same reasoning, for two finite unramified extensions
  $L_1,L_2$ we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{p3-intersection}
    \O_{L_1 \cap L_2} = \O_{L_1} \cap \O_{L_2}.
  \end{equation}

  Now, if we fix some algebraic closure $\Q_p^\alg$ of $\Q_p$, and let
  $I$ denote the set of finite unramified subextensions $L \subseteq
  \Q_p^\alg$ over $\Q_p$, then it follows from
  (\ref{p3-compatibility}) that since $\Q_p^\ur = \bigcup_I L$ then
  \[
  \O_{\Q_p^\ur} = \bigcup_I \O_L, \quad \m_{\Q_p^\ur} = \bigcup_I
  \m_L.
  \]
  And from (\ref{p3-intersection}) it's fairly clear that these unions
  over $I$ are isomorphic to the respective colimits (in the category
  of $\O_K$-algebras) over $I$ (now viewed as the \emph{category} of
  finite unramified subextensions). Then since quotients commute with
  colimits, we have $k_{\Q_p^\ur} \iso \colim_I k_L$. But since the
  residue field functor is an equivalence of categories of $I$ with
  the category of finite extensions of $\F_p$, this colimit is just
  the algebraic closure $\F_p^\alg$.
\end{itemize}

\subprob{c}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $K \inj L$ is an extension with $e = e_{L/K}$ then we know
  $\im(v_L) = \frac{1}{e} \im(v_K)$. Since there exist extensions of
  $\Q_p$ with arbitrary ramification index (e.g. we showed in lecture
  that $\Q_p(p^{1/e})$ is totally ramified of degree $e \in \N$), it
  must be that $v_p(\Q_p^\alg)$ is the subgroup of $\R$ generated by
  $\frac{1}{e} \Z$ for all $e \in \N$, which is visibly $\Q$.
\item Since ramification does not affect the residue fields, nothing
  changes: we still get $\F_p^\alg$.
\end{itemize}

\prob{2}

Factor $K \inj L$ as $K \inj K' \inj L$ where $K \inj K'$ is
unramified and $K' \inj L$ is totally ramified. We have proven in
lecture the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{p2-unramified} Let $k_K$ and $k_{K'} \iso k_L$ denote the
  residue fields. Then for $x \in \O_{K'}$ we have $k_{K'} = k_K(\o x)
  \implies K' = K(x)$. Hence we can choose $x \in K'$ such that $K' =
  K(x + a)$ for any $a \in \m_{K'}$.
\item \label{p2-ramified} If $\pi_L \in \O_L$ is any uniformizer, $L =
  K'(\pi_L)$.
\end{enumerate}
Now, if $K' = L$, i.e. $K \inj L$ is unramified, then we are done by
(\ref{p2-unramified}). So assume $K' \ne L$. Fix any uniformizer
$\pi_L \in \O_L$. Combining (\ref{p2-unramified}) and
(\ref{p2-ramified}) gives that $L = K(x,\pi_L)$. Let $L' \ce K(x +
\pi_L) \subseteq L$. Since $K' \inj L$ is a nontrivial totally
ramified extension, we must have $v_L(\pi_L) < v_L(x)$, implying
$v_L(x + \pi_L) = v_L(\pi_L)$. Thus
\[
[L':K'] \ge e_{L'/K'} = e_{L/K'} = [L:K],
\]
proving $L = L'$, as desired.

\prob{3}

\subprob{a}

Our proof from lecture in characteristic zero in fact shows more
precisely that if $K$ is a local, nonarchimedean field and $d \in \N$
such that, for all $e \mid d$, all monic irreducible polynomials of
degree $e$ over $K$ are separable, then $K$ has finitely many
extensions of degree $d$.

So it suffices to show that if $\charac(K) = p$ and $(p,e) = 1$, then
all monic irreducible polynomials of degree $e$ over $K$ are
separable. Let $K \inj L$ be an extension of degree $e$. Let $L^\sep$
be the subextension of separable elements in $L$. Then the extension
$L^\sep \inj L$ is purely inseparable, so over $L^\sep$ any $x \in L$
has minimal polynomial of the form $t^{p^r} - a$ with $a \in
L^\sep$. But then
\[
p^r \mid [L : L^\sep] \mid [L : K] = e \implies r = 0,
\]
so $x \in L^\sep$. Thus $K \inj L$ is separable, as desired.

\subprob{b}

To show $K/\wp(K)$ is infinite-dimensional over $\F_p$ it suffices to
show it has infinitely many elements. We will show this by proving
that the classes of $t^{-n}$ for $n \in \N$ with $(n,p) = 1$ are all
distinct. If not, then for some $m,n \in \N$ with $(m,p) = (n,p) = 1$
we have $t^{-m} - t^{-n} = w^p - w$ for some $w \in W$. Write
\[
\textstyle{w = \sum_{k=k_0}^\infty a_k t^k, \quad w^p =
  \sum_{k=k_0}^\infty a_k^p t^{pk}}.
\]
Since $w^p$ has terms only in degrees which are multiples of $p$, we
must have $a_{-m} \ne 0$. But then since $w^p - w$ is concentrated in
degrees $-m,-n$ and $(n,p)=1$, we must have $a_{-p^rm} = a_{-m}^p \ne
0$ for all $r \in \N$. This is of course a contradiction.

\subprob{4}

Note that $x^3 - 2$ is obviously separable over $\Q_2$ so that $L$ is
Galois over $\Q_2$. Since $G \ce \Gal(L/\Q_2) \inj S_3$ we then know
$[L:\Q_2] \le 6$.

Let $\alpha$ be a root of $x^3 - 2$ in $L$, and let $\omega$ be a
primitive third root of unity adjoined in $L(\omega)$. But clearly
$\omega\alpha$ is also a root of $x^3-2$ in $L(\omega)$, so
$\omega\alpha \in L$ and hence $\omega = \omega\alpha/\alpha \in L$.

Consider the subextension $L_1 \ce \Q_2(\alpha) \subseteq L$. We have
$\alpha^3 = 2 \implies v_2(\alpha) \le 1/3$ so that $e_{L_1/\Q_2} \ge
3$.

Consider the subextension $L_2 \ce \Q_2(\omega) \subseteq L$. Since
$\omega \ne 1$, we know $\omega$ satisfies the polynomial $p(t) = t^2
+ t + 1$. Since $p$ is irreducible over $\F_2$, it follows that
$f_{L_2/\Q_2} \ge 2$.

But now
\[
6 \ge [L:\Q_2] = e_{L/K}f_{L/K} \ge e_{L_1/K}f_{L_2/K} = 3 \cdot 2 =
6,
\]
so we must in fact have $e_{L/K} = 3$, $f_{L/K} = 2$, and $[L:\Q_2] =
6$. In particular $G \iso S_3$ and $|G/G_0| = 2$ so $G_0$ must be the
unique index two subgroup $\Z/3 \iso A_3 \subset S_3$.

\subprob{5}

We proved in lecture that we must have $L = K(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$
satisfies the polynomial $t^n - \pi$ for some uniformizer $\pi \in
\O_K$. Consider the field $L(\zeta)$ adjoining a primitive $n$-th root
of unity $\zeta$. Then $\zeta\alpha$ is also a root of $t^n - \pi$, so
since $L$ is Galois we have $\zeta = \zeta\alpha/\alpha \in L$.

Since $L$ is totally ramified over $K$, to show $\zeta \in K$ we just
need to show $K(\zeta)$ is unramified over $K$. But since $L$ is
tamely ramified, we know $1 = G_1$ is the unique Sylow-$\charac(K)$
subgroup of $G_0$. Since $|G_0| = n$ this implies $(n,\charac(K)) =
1$. Now an argument essentially identical to the one given in Problem
1a shows that $K(\zeta)$ is indeed unramified over $K$.

Finally, since $\zeta$ is primitive, the elements $\zeta^k$ for $0 \le
k \le n-1$ are all distinct (and nonzero), and hence
$\{\zeta^k\alpha\}$ are the $n$ distinct roots of $t^n-\pi$. Thus we
have an injection $\Gal(L/K) \inj \Z/n$ by sending $\sigma$ to the
unique $k$ such that $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^k\alpha$. This is a
homomorphism because $\zeta \in K$ is fixed by $\Gal(L/K)$. And since
$|G|=n$ this must be an isomorphism, proving $\Gal(L/K)$ is cyclic.
