\section{Generalities}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{bordism category} is a category $\B$ equipped with a functor
  $\d \c \B \to \B$ and natural transformation $\iota \c \d \to
  \id_\B$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\B$ has finite coproducts $M \amalg N$, including an initial
    object $\e$;
  \item $\B$ is essentially small, i.e., has a small subcategory
    $\B_0$ such that every $M \in \obj(\B)$ is isomorphic to some $M_0
    \in \obj(\B_0)$;
  \item $\d$ and $\iota$ preserve coproducts;
  \item $\d\e \simeq \e$ and $\d\d M \simeq \e$ for all $M \in
    \obj(\B)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{main-example}
  Hopefully the notation is suggestive enough so that this motivating
  example is predictable. We take $\B$ to be the category $\Mfld$ of
  compact smooth manifolds (with boundary) and smooth maps, $\d$ to be
  the boundary, and $\iota$ to be the inclusion of the
  boundary. Finite coproducts in $\Mfld$ are given by disjoint union,
  and $\e$ is the empty manifold. Note, $\Mfld$ is essentially small
  because every object can be embedded as a subset of $\R^\infty$.
\end{example}

In the remainder of this section we state some elementary facts about
a general bordism category $\B$. Then in the next section we will
address this main example (although in slightly more generality, by
letting our manifolds have extra structure and working over a base
space). We will in particular discuss at the end why this definition
of bordism is equivalent to the more familiar one for manifolds.

\begin{definitions}
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item We say $M,N \in \obj(\B)$ are \emph{bordant}, and write $M
    \equiv N$, if there exist $U,V \in \obj(\B)$ such that $M \amalg
    \d U \simeq N \amalg \d V$.
  \item The relation $\equiv$ is called \emph{bordism}.
  \item We say $M \in \obj(\B)$ is \emph{closed} if $\d M \simeq \e$ and
    a \emph{boundary} if $M \equiv \e$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definitions}

\begin{proposition} \label{bordism-props}
  Let $K,L,M,N \in \obj(\B)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Bordism is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes
    form a set.
  \item $M \equiv N \implies \d M \simeq \d N$.
  \item $\d M \equiv \e$.
  \item \label{bordism-sum} $K \equiv M, L \equiv N \implies K \amalg
    L \equiv M \amalg N$.
  \item If $M \equiv N$ then $M$ is closed (resp. a boundary) if and
    only if $N$ is closed (resp. a boundary).
  \item \label{closed-sum} If $M,N$ are closed (resp. boundaries) then $M \amalg N$ is
    closed (resp. a boundary).
  \item If $M$ is a boundary then $M$ is closed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Easy. (Note that we required $\B$ to be essentially small precisely
  so that the bordism classes form a set.)
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Omega(\B)$ denote the set of bordism classes of closed objects
  of $\B$. By (\ref{bordism-props}.\ref{bordism-sum}) and
  (\ref{bordism-props}.\ref{closed-sum}), coproduct in $\B$ induces a
  commutative monoid structure on $\Omega(\B)$, with identity given by
  $\e$.
\end{definition}

\section{Bordism of (structured) manifolds}

Let's first discuss the type of structure we will allow on our
manifolds. It will come from structure on the stable normal bundle, so
we begin there.

\begin{notation}
  Let $TM$ denote the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold $M$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition} \label{normal-bundle} Let $i \c M \to N$ be an
  immersion of smooth manifolds. The \emph{normal bundle} $\nu_i$ of
  $i$ (or of $M$ in $N$) is the vector bundle on $M$ defined by the
  short exact sequence $0 \to TM \to i^*TN \to \nu_i \to 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} \label{normal-composition}
  Let $i \c L \to M$ and $j \c M \to N$ be immersions of smooth
  manifolds. Let $k \ce j \circ i$. Then there is a short exact
  sequence $0 \to \nu_i \to \nu_k \to i^*\nu_j \to 0$ of bundles on
  $L$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Since pullback of vector bundles is exact we have
  \[
  i^*\nu_j \simeq i^*\l(\f{j^*TN}{TM}\r) \simeq \f{k^*TN}{i^*TM} \simeq
  \f{k^*TN/TL}{i^*TM/TL} \simeq \f{\nu_k}{\nu_i}. \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} \label{stable-normal}
  Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. let $\xi \in [M, BO]$ be the
  homotopy class classifying the tangent bundle $TM \to M$
  (stably). The \emph{stable normal bundle} $\nu_M$ of $M$ is defined
  as the inverse of $\xi$ in the group $[M, BO] \simeq \wt{KO}(M)$.

  Note if $i \c M \to \R^n$ is an immersion (which always exists, as
  remarked in \pref{main-example}) then by definition we have a short
  exact sequence
  \[
  0 \to TM \to i^*T\R^n \to \nu_i \to 0.
  \]
  Since $T\R^n$ is trivial it follows that $\nu_i$ is inverse to $TM$
  in $\wt{KO}(M)$. Thus the stable classifying map $M \to BO$ of
  $\nu_i$ determines the homotopy class of the stable normal bundle
  $\nu_M$ (hence the terminology). But note that, by definition,
  $\nu_M$ does not depend on the choice of dimension $n$ and immersion
  $i$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definitions} \label{f-structure} Let $f \c B \to BO$ be a
  fibration. Let $\xi$ be a vector bundle on a compact smooth manifold
  $M$. Let $g \c M \to BO$ be a map classifying $\xi$. An
  \emph{$f$-structure} on $\xi$ is the fibrewise homotopy\footnote{A
    \emph{fibrewise homotopy} of lifts $\wt g, \wt g'$ is a homotopy
    $h_t \c M \to B$ such that $f \circ h_t = g$ for all $t \in
    [0,1]$.}  class $[\wt g]$ of a lift in the diagram
  \begin{equation} \label{f-structure-lift}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \ & B \ar{d}{f} \\ M \ar[dashed]{ur}{\wt g} \ar{r}{g} & BO.
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation}
  The $f$-structure only depends on the homotopy class $[g]$, or
  equivalently on the stable bundle determined by $\xi$. This will be
  explained below in \pref{f-structure-explanation} after we state some
  examples to keep in mind.

  An \emph{$f$-structure} on a compact smooth manifold $M$ is an
  $f$-structure on its stable normal bundle $\nu_M$.
\end{definitions}

\begin{examples} \label{f-examples}
  Why should we care about fibrations $B \to BO$? Well, maybe the
  primary class of examples will answer that. Whenever we have a
  morphism of topological groups $\phi \c G \to O$ we get a fibration
  $f \ce B\phi \c BG \to BO$. In particular if we have a sequence of
  morphisms
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    G(0) \ar{r} \ar{d} & G(1) \ar{r} \ar{d} & G(2) \ar{r} \ar{d} &
    \cdots \ar{d} \\ O(0) \ar{r} & O(1) \ar{r} & O(2) \ar{r} & \cdots
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  we get a morphism $\colim_n G(n) \ec G \to O \ce \colim_n
  O(n)$. Then a lift in \pref{f-structure-lift} is a reduction of the
  structure group of the bundle to $G$, and indeed in this situation
  we will abusively refer to $f$-structures (on bundles and manifolds)
  as \emph{$G$-structures}. Here are some important subexamples:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The most basic case comes from the identity $\id \c O \to O$,
    inducing $f = \id \c BO \to BO$. Obviously every vector bundle on
    a compact smooth manifold, and hence every compact smooth
    manifold, has a unique $O$-structure.
  \item Slightly less trivially we have the inclusion $SO \to O$
    coming from the inclusions $SO(n) \to O(n)$. This induces the
    two-to-one cover $BSO \to BO$ arising from a choice of
    orientation. Indeed an $SO$-structure on a manifold is precisely
    an orientation.
  \item The inclusions $U(n) \to O(2n)$ give a morphism $U \to O$ and
    hence a fibration $BU \to BO$. A $U$-structure on a manifold is
    called an \emph{almost-complex structure}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

I think it's worth discussing for a bit why \pref{f-structure} should
be stated in the way it is. It certainly confused me for a while. We
will explain this by considering the case $B = BSO$, and actually
proving what we just claimed: giving an $SO$-structure on a compact
smooth manifold $M$ is equivalent to giving an orientation on $M$.

\begin{lemma} \label{normal-orientation}
  Let $i \c M \to \R^m$ be an immersion. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Orienting the normal bundle $\nu_i$ is equivalent to orienting
    $M$.
  \item If $j \c M \to \R^n$ is a another immersion, there is a
    bijection
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remarks} \label{f-structure-explanation}
  As claimed in \pref{f-examples}(ii), Given an immersion $i \c M \to
  \R^n$, orienting $\nu_i$ is equivalent to orienting $TM$ (by
  \pref{normal-bundle} of $\nu_i$ and the fact that $\R^n$ has a
  canonical orientation) which in turn is equivalent to orienting
  $M$. This is the essential point, but there are still some details
  to work through since we are working with the \emph{stable} normal
  bundle.

  Recall that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item we can always find such an immersion $i$;
  \item an orientation on a $k$-dimensional vector bundle is
    equivalent to a reduction of its structure group to $SO(k)$,
    i.e. a lift from the classifying map to $BO(k)$ to a map to
    $BSO(k)$.
  \end{itemize}
  Since $\nu_i$ determines $\nu_M$ this implies than an orientation on
  $M$ indeed determines a lift in \pref{f-structure-lift}, and hence a
  $BSO$-structure on $M$. For the other direction, note that since $M$
  is compact, a lift $\wt g \c M \to BSO$ factors through some
  $BSO(k)$, and thus a lift determines (for large enough embedding
  dimension $n$) a reduction of the structure group of $\nu_i$ to
  $SO(k)$, and hence an orientation on $M$.

  However, these correspondences aren't really well-defined, since we
  have made choices. I won't discuss why these are independent of the
  choice of immersion $i$
\end{remarks}

\begin{proposition} \label{trivial-normal}
  Let $i \c M \to N$ be an immersion of compact smooth manifolds whose
  normal bundle $\nu_i$ is trivial. Then $\nu_M = i^*\nu_N$, and for
  any fibration $f \c B \to BO$, an $f$-structure on $N$ induces a
  canonical $f$-structure on $M$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Choose an immersion $j \c N \to \R^n$ and let $k \ce j \circ i$. By
  \pref{normal-composition} we have an exact sequene $0 \to \nu_i \to
  \nu_k \to i^*\nu_j \to 0$. Since $\nu_i$ is trivial, $\nu_k$ and
  $i^*\nu_j$ are equal in $\wt{KO}(M) \simeq [M,BO]$. By the discussion
  in \pref{stable-normal} we know then that if we take a map $N \to BO$
  classifying the stable normal bundle $\nu_N$, then its restriction
  to $M$ will classify $\nu_M$, as desired. It follows immediately
  that any lift defining an $f$-structure on $N$ canonically restricts
  to a lift defining an $f$-structure on $M$.
\end{proof}

Finally we may define the bordism categories of manifolds, whose
bordism classes we will analyse in future posts.

\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ be a space and $f \c B \to BO$ a fibration. The category
  $\Mfld^f_X$ of \emph{compact smooth manifolds with $f$-structure
    over $X$*} is defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item objects are continuous maps $M \to X$ where $M$ is a compact
    smooth manifold equipped with an $f$-structure (note we will often
    abuse as usual and refer to an object of simply by the underlying
    manifold $M$);
  \item morphisms are commutative diagrams
    \[
    % \begin{xy}
    %   \xymatrix {
    %   M \ar[rr]^i \ar[dr] & & N \ar[dl] \\
    %   & X &
    % }
    % \end{xy}
    \]
    where $i$ is a smooth immersion whose normal bundle $\nu_i$ is
    trivial, such that the $f$-structure induced by $i$ on $M$ by
    \pref{trivial-normal} agrees with its equipped $f$-structure.
  \end{itemize}

  We claim $\Mfld^f_X$ is in fact a bordism category. Generalising
  \pref{main-example}, we still take $\d$ to be the boundary and
  $\iota$ to be the inclusion of the boundary, noting that the
  inclusion $\d M \to M$ always has trivial normal
  bundle\footnote{That $\d M \to M$ has trivial normal bundle can be
    seen by the existence of a collar: an open neighbourhood $U
    \subseteq M$ of $\d M$ isomorphic to $\d M \times [0, 1)$ with $\d
    M$ identified with $\d M \times \{0\}$. For $\d M \times \{0\} \to
    \d M \times [0,1)$ certainly has trivial normal bundle, and the
    open embedding $U \to M$ obviously has zero-dimensional normal
    bundle, so then it's immediate from \pref{normal-composition}. See,
    e.g., [Kosinski][kosinski] for a proof of the existence of a
    collar.} so that $M$ induces a canonical $f$-structure on $\d M$
  by \pref{trivial-normal}. Moreover:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Obviously the unique map from the empty manifold $\e \to X$
    gives the initial object. We claim disjoint union still gives
    finite coproducts. Given maps $M \to X$ and $N \to X$ there is of
    course a canonical map $M \amalg N \to X$. Moreover $[M \amalg N,
    B] \simeq [M, B] \times [N, B]$ so $f$-structures on $M$ and $N$
    induce a canonical $f$-structure on $M \amalg N$. The maps $M \to
    M \amalg N$ and $N \to M \amalg N$ are open embeddings, so are
    clearly immersions with trivial (zero-dimensional) normal
    bundles. It's not difficult to see then that $M \amalg N \to X$
    really does define a coproduct in $\Mfld^f_X$.
  \item Essential smallness follows again from the embedding theorem.
  \item Clearly $\d$ and $\iota$ preserve coproducts.
  \item It's also evident that $\d\e \simeq \e$ and $\d\d M \simeq \e$.
  \end{enumerate}
  So indeed we have a bordism category.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  One might be concerned that we haven't properly generalised
  \pref{main-example} since we have restricted our set of
  morphisms. But since we have the same coproduct and boundary, and we
  only need to care about \emph{isomorphisms} to define the set of bordism
  classes $\Omega(\Mfld^f_X)$, indeed setting $X$ to be a point and $f
  \ce \id \c BO \to BO$ recovers the same bordism classes
  $\Omega(\Mfld)$ of compact smooth manifolds.
\end{remark}

We finish by assuring ourselves that we aren't working with some
ridiculous notion of bordism, as promised above. Fix a space $X$ and
fibration $f \c B \to BO$ for the remainder.

\begin{lemma} \label{cross-interval}
  Suppose $M \in \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ is closed. Then $M \times I$ has the
  structure (not necessarily unique) of an object of $\Mfld^f_X$ such
  that the inclusion $i \c M \simeq M \times \{0\} \inj M \times I$
  determines a morphism in $\Mfld^f_X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since $M$ is closed, $M \times I$ is a compact smooth manifold and
  composition with projection $M \times I \to M \to X$ gives us a map
  to $X$. Now, $\nu_i$ is clearly trivial, so by \pref{trivial-normal}
  we have $\nu_M = i^*\nu_{M \times I}$. I.e., we have a commutative
  diagram
  \[
  % \begin{xy}
  %   \xymatrix{
  %     M \ar[r]^{\wt g} \ar[d]_i \ar[dr]^g & B \ar[d]^f \\
  %     M \times I \ar[r]^h & BO
  %   }
  % \end{xy}
  \]
  where $g$ classifies $\nu_M$, $h$ classifies $\nu_{M \times I}$, and
  $\wt g$ gives the $f$-structure on $M$. Since $f$ is a fibration
  there exists a lift $\wt h \c M \times I \to B$ in the diagram. It's
  then clear that the $f$-structure $[\tilde h]$ on $M \times I$ is as
  desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} \label{inverse}
  Let $M \in \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ be closed. Let $M \times I \in
  \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ be as given by \pref{cross-interval}. Observe that
  \[
  \d(M \times I) = M \times \{0\} \amalg M \times \{1\} \simeq M \amalg M'
  \]
  where $M'$ has the same underlying manifold and map to $X$ as $M$,
  but possibly a different $f$-structure. We call $M'$ an *inverse* of
  $M$; this is not unique since the $f$-structure on $M \times I$ is
  not unique, but we abusively denote any inverse by $-M$. (This
  terminology and notation will be earned below.)
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} \label{inverse-props}
  One may check easily that the following properties hold for $M,N \in
  \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If we have an isomorpshism $M \to N$ then the canonical
    morphisms $M \times I \to N \times I$ and $-M \to -N$ are
    isomorphisms.
  \item Inverse respects coproducts: $-(M \amalg N) \simeq -M \amalg
    -N$.
  \item Inverse is an involution: $-(-M) \simeq M$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $M,N \in \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ be closed. Then $M \equiv N$ if and
  only if there exists $W \in \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ such that $M \amalg -N
  \simeq \d W$ for some inverse $-N$ of $N$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $M \amalg -N \simeq \d W$. By \pref{inverse} we
  have $N \times I \in \obj(\Mfld^f_X)$ such that $\d(N \times I) \simeq
  -N \amalg N$. Then
  \[
  M \amalg \d(N \times I) \simeq M \amalg -N \amalg N \simeq \d W
  \amalg N
  \]
  so $M \equiv N$.

  ($\Leftarrow$) Assume $M \equiv N$, so $M \amalg \d U \simeq N
  \amalg d V$.
\end{proof}
