\prob{1}

Let $x,y \in X$ distinct. Without loss of generality $\p_x
\not\subseteq \p_y$. Then there exists $f \in \p_x - \p_y$. Then $y
\in D(f)$ but $x \notin D(f)$ by definition.

\prob{3}

Let $\p \in \Spec K[x,y]$. We have the following three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\p = (0)$: Nothing to see here.
\item $\p$ is maximal: By the Nullstellensatz, this holds if and only
  if $\p = (x-a, y-b)$ for some $a,b \in K$.
\item $\p$ is nonzero and nonmaximal: Pick any nonzero $f \in
  \p$. Since $K[x,y]$ is a UFD we can write $f = \prod_{i=1}^n
  f_i^{r_i}$, where $f_i \in K[x,y]$ are irreducible and $r_i \in
  \N$. So (since $\p$ is prime) we can take $f$ to be irreducible with
  no restriction of generality. Again since $K[x,y]$ is a UFD, this
  implies $(f)$ is prime. So we have a chain of prime ideals
  \[
  (0) \subsetneq (f) \subseteq \p \subsetneq \m,
  \]
  where $\m$ is some maximal ideal containing $\p$. But then
  \[
  \dim_{\text{Krull}}K[x,y] = 2 \implies \p = (f).
  \]
  We conclude then that the nonzero, nonmaximal elements of $\Spec
  K[x,y]$ are precisely the principal ideals generated by irreducible
  elements.
\end{itemize}
