\begin{prob}{1a}
  Let $X \simeq \A^1_k \simeq \Spec k[t]$. Then to give a coherent
  sheaf $\F$ on $X$ is to give a finitely generated $k[t]$-module $M$
  and to give an exact sequence $0 \to \F' \to \F \to \F'' \to 0$ of
  coherent sheaves is to give an exact sequence $0 \to M' \to M \to
  M'' \to 0$ of $k[t]$-modules. Thus we can speak in terms of finitely
  generated modules instead of coherent sheaves. We note the following
  immediately:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item As $k[t]$ is a domain, for any exact sequence $0 \to M' \to M
    \to M'' \to 0$ we have $\rk(M) = \rk(M') + \rk(M'')$.
  \item If $M \simeq M' \oplus M''$ then there is an exact sequence $0
    \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$, implying $\gamma(M) = \gamma(M') +
    \gamma(M'')$.
  \item Any finitely generated $k[t]$-module can be decomposed as $M
    \simeq F \oplus T$ where $F$ is free with $\rk(M) = \rk(F)$ and $T
    \simeq \bigoplus k[t]/(f)$ is torsion with $\rk(T) = 0$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \medskip
  By (1), rank (extended linearly) gives a well defined map $K(X) \to
  \Z$. Surjectivity of this map is clear, so we just need
  injectivity. Combining (2) and (3), we have for any $M \simeq F
  \oplus T$ that $\gamma(M) = \rk(M)\gamma(k[t]) + \sum
  \gamma(k[t]/(f))$. It follows that to show injectivity it suffices
  to show $\gamma(k[t]/(f)) = 0$, but this is immediate from the
  exactness of
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    0 \rar & k[t] \rar{\cdot f} & k[t] \rar & k[t]/(f) \rar & 0.
  \end{tikzcd}
  \qedhere
  \]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}{1b}
  Any exact sequence $0 \to F' \to F \to F'' \to 0$ induces an exact
  sequence $0 \to F'_\xi \to F_\xi \to F''_\xi \to 0$, implying
  $\dim_K(F_\xi) = \dim_K(F'_\xi) + \dim_K(F''_\xi)$. Hence the map
  $K(X) \to \Z$ defined in the problem is well defined. The map is
  surjective simply because, for $n \ge 0$, taking $F \coloneqq
  \O_X^n$ gives $\dim_K(F_\xi) = \dim_K(K^n) = n$.

\begin{prob}{2a}
  Let $D = \sum n_iP_i$ an effective divisor then clearly we have $\O_D
  \simeq \bigoplus \O_{n_iP_i}$. Thus by observation (2) from Problem 1
  it suffices to treat the case $D = nP$. We'll proceed by induction on
  $n \ge 1$. For $n = 1$ we simply have $\O_D \simeq \O_P \simeq
  k(P)$.

  \medskip
  Now suppose $n > 1$. By our hypotheses on $X$ we have that $A
  \coloneqq \O_{X,P}$ is a DVR. Then letting, $\I$ the ideal sheaf of
  $\{P\}$, we have $\I_P = (f)$ with $f \in A$ a uniformiser, and
  $\I_x \simeq \O_{X,x}$ for $x \in X - \{P\}$. By definition of the
  correspondence between divisors and (locally principal) closed
  subschemes, it follows that $\O_D \simeq \O_{nP} \simeq
  \O_X/\I^n$. Thus by induction it suffices to give an exact sequence
  \[
  0 \to \O/\I^{n-1} \to \O/\I^n \to \O/\I \simeq k(P) \to 0.
  \]
  But since all of these are skyscraper sheaves with support $\{P\}$
  it moreover suffices to give an exact sequence
  \[
  0 \to A/(f^{n-1}) \to A/(f^n) \to A/(f) \to 0,
  \]
  of stalks at $P$. But this is immediate from the exact sequence $0
  \to A \to A \to A/(f) \to 0$, so we win.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}{3}
  Note $X$ has an open cover $U \cup V$ of dense affines $\A^1_k
  \simeq \Spec k[t]$. Thus $k[t]$ being a noetherian UFD implies that
  $X$ is integral, noetherian, and locally factorial. Thus as proved
  in lecture we have $\Pic(X) \simeq \Cl(X)$, so it suffices to prove
  $\Cl(X) \simeq \Z$.

  \medskip
  Let $0, 0' \in X$ denote the two origins. Note $Z \coloneqq \{0\}$
  and $Z' \coloneqq \{0'\}$ are closed of codimension $1$ in $X$. Let
  $U \coloneqq X - Z$ so $U \simeq \A^1_k$. We know $\Cl(\A^1_k)
  \simeq 0$. Therefore the exact sequence $\Z \to \Cl(X) \to \Cl(U)
  \to 0$ tells us that the map $\Z \to \Cl(X)$ sending $1 \mapsto [Z]$
  is surjective. It remains to show that the map is injective, i.e.,
  that $nZ$ is not principal for any $n \in \Z$. But of course we have
  $\O_{X,0} \simeq k[t]_{(t)} \simeq \O_{X,0'}$, so for any $f \in
  k(X)$, the valuations $\nu_Z(f) = \nu_{Z'}(f)$ must agree. It
  follows that $nZ$ cannot be principal.
