i'm arpon, an undergraduate at harvard. i'm mostly focused on trying
to understand (parts of) math. this site is basically a place for me
to [blog][blog] short snippets, and keep some longer expository
[writing][writing], on the subject.

i'm nearly always distracted by design, music, programming, running,
tennis, or tv. this site is also an outlet for these things---i'm
constantly redesigning it for no reason, and might occasionally blog
about this non-math stuff.
