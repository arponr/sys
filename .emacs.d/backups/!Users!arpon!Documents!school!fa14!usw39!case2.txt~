federal negative: james madison's idea that the national government
should have the right to veto any state law. a reaction to the failure
of the articles of confederation following the revolution (madison
believed too much power lied in the individual states' hands). others
thought this gave the national government too much power over the
states, this a central topic of debate at the consitutional convention
of 1787.
