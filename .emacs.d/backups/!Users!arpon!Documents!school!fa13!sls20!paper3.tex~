\section{The Big Idea}

\subsection{Definition}

In the process of \textit{implicit learning}, the learner does not
have explicit awareness of what is being learned or how it is being
learned. A prevalent example of this process is the formation of
\textit{implicit associations}. E.g., in our native language we have
associated certain constructions in the language as correct, or
meaningful, and others as not. However, very few of us know precisely
the formal grammar underlying the language, or can describe how we
learned (at least the rudiments of) the language. In this sense the
associations made in learning language are implicit.

This example highlights the power of implicit associations, allowing
us to learn and generalise concepts as complex as language. This
power, however, is not always so beneficial. E.g., being exposed only
to white doctors or hispanic labourers might lead to implicit
associations between race and profession, which may not be
well-founded or cause harmful overgeneralisation. In any case, both
these positive and negative examples demonstrate that implicit
associations can play a considerable role in the way we perceive and
behave in the world, and in particular with respect to other people.

\subsection{IATs}

For this reason, it is interesting and important to try to understand
more scientifically the formation and consequences of implicit
associations. But, by definition, people are unaware of these
associations, and in many cases are reluctant to discover or discuss
them. Thus it is inherently difficult to study implicit associations
directly. Indeed, one needs to devise measures and tests which are
themselves implicit.

In section we participated in and discussed such an \textit{implicit
  association test (IAT)} regarding fields of study and gender, akin
to the race-profession example above. In the test we were required to
categorise as quickly as possible four classes of concepts---male,
female, sciences, and humanities---into two categories---left and
right. In some rounds male was grouped with the sciences and in other
rounds with the humanities. Our implicit association between field of
study and gender was measured by measuring our classification speed in
these two types of rounds. Plausibly, faster classification should
indicate a stronger association between the classes grouped
together. This sort of classification test seems to be a very general
and powerful way to measure implicit associations. Moreover it is
successful in measuring associations in an indirect and implicit
manner, which as mentioned above is necessary for such a protocol.

\section{The Article}

In ``Implicit attitude generalization occurs immediately; explicit
attitude generalization takes time'', the authors measure the ways in
and extent to which people generalise opinions of individuals to
opinions about associated groups. Roughly the study was as
follows. Two individuals $A$ and $B$ were described to participants,
$A$ primarily positively and $B$ primarily negatively. Then two other
individuals--$C$ and $D$, members of (large and not tight-knit) groups
containing $A$ and $B$, respectively---were described, both equally
and neutrally. After each set of descriptions, participants took IATs
and gave ratings, providing measures of their implicit and explicit
preferences for the individuals. The same measures were recorded a few
days later as well.

The results of these measurements are that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the measurements immediately following their description, $C$
  was explicitly rated slightly better and $C$, but implicitly
  preferred strongly to $D$. This suggests implicit generalisations
  are made immediately, while when making explicit ratings people are
  able to inhibit overgeneralisation.
\item In the measurements recorded after a few days, both explicit
  ratings and implicit association showed significant preference for
  $C$ to $D$. This suggests implicit generalisations persist over
  time, and explicit generalisations are eventually made.
\end{enumerate}
Of course these results highlight an interesting difference between
the formation of implicit and explicit associations. The idea that
implicit learning can quickly (though perhaps not beneficially or
correctly) lead to generalisations and associations is made clear
here. So is the idea that with details to work with, deliberation can
successfully distinguish between well-founded generalisations and
overgeneralisations, whereas after time, with only a gist of the
details recalled, overgeneralisations are more readily made. These
results give great evidence that IATs can be used to effectively study
implicit learning, and in particular confirm expected, though not
evident, findings as those supported in this article.

\section{Discussion}

When discussing learning and conditioning in this course, it was
mentioned that particular behaviours are more easily learned, and in
this sense are more \textit{natural}, than others. This suggests
interesting questions to ask about implicit associations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are there certain types of implicit associations which are
  more easily learned or more natural than others?
\item If so, can we characterise these types of associations?
\item And if so, how universally do these characterisations hold?
  I.e., do people of different race, culture, geographic location,
  etc. naturally learn different associations?
\end{enumerate}
I think answers to these questions might shed some light on the
evolutionary aspect of implicit associations.

By this I mean that, the ability to quickly and implicitly (as
demonstrated in the article) generalise concepts seems evidently to be
evolutionarily advantageous. In particular, this ability of the brain
allows for rapid adaptation to changes in or introduction of new
elements in the environment. However this really is a
\textit{particular} case of implicit association. I think that being
able to associate groups of people with positive or negative
individual actions has obvious evolutionary advantages in the
development of effective eusociality. Contrastingly, forming more
artificial associations, say between random pairings of foods and
books, do not have obvious evolutionary advantages. I would conjecture
the more natural, evolutionary implicit associations could be learned
more quickly and more effectively. And conversely, discovering which
types of implicit associations are learned more easily and by whom
could provide information about what associations are naturally
useful.

One could probably start studying these questions simply with the
methodology of the article discussed above. One could compare with the
same measures how readily people form implicit associations of various
(hypothesised) degrees of ``naturality'' to answer questions (1) and
(2), and of course test various groups of people to answer question
(3).
