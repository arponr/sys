\prob{1}

\subprob{a}

Let $S = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ be a convergent series in $\Q_p$. Let
$\sigma \c \N \to \N$ be a bijection. Fix $\epsilon > 0$. We must have
$a_k \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, so we may choose some $m \in \N$ such
that $\abs{a_k} < \epsilon$ for $k \ge m$. Since $\sigma$ is a
bijection we may choose $n \in \N$ such that $\sigma(k) \ge m$ for
$k \ge n$. Then $\abs{a_{\sigma(k)}} < \epsilon$ for $k \ge
n$. Hence $a_{\sigma(k)} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$. By Problem Set 2,
Problem 4d this implies $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(k)}$ converges.

Now to show $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(k)} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$
it suffices to show $d_n \ce \sum_{k=1}^n a_k - \sum_{k=1}^n
a_{\sigma(k)} \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. We have $d_n = \sum_{k \in
  K_n} a_k - \sum_{k \in K'_n} a_k$ where
\[
K_n \ce \{k \in \N : k \le n, \sigma(k) > n\}, \quad
K'_n \ce \{k \in \N : k > n, \sigma(k) \le n\}.
\]
Then $\abs{d_n} \le \max\{\abs{a_k} : k \in K_n \cup K'_n\}$. Since
$a_k \to 0$ and $a_{\sigma(k)} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, it follows
that $d_n \to 0$ as well.

\subprob{b}

This follows from the same argument given for $\exp_p$ in
lecture. Namely, it suffices to show $\limsup \abs{a_n}_p^{1/n} \le
p^{1/(p-1)}$ for $a_{2n} = (-1)^n/((2n)!)$ or $a_{2n+1} =
(-1)^n/((2n+1)!)$, and this is immediate from
\[
v_p(n!) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \l\lfloor\f{n}{p^i}\r\rfloor \le
\sum_{i=1}^\infty \f{n}{p^i} = \f{n}{p-1}.
\]

\subprob{c}

Consider the polynomial $f(t) \ce t^2 + 1$. If $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$
then we know that $f$ has a root $\o x$ in $\F_p$. We may lift $\o x$
to an $x \in \Z_p$, and since $f'(x) = 2x$ and $2$ is invertible in
$\F_p$, by Hensel's lemma we can find a root $i \in \Z_p$ of $f$, so
that $i^2 = -1$.

Note then that $\abs{i}^2_p = \abs{-1}_p = 1 \implies \abs{i}_p =
1$. In particular $\exp_p(ix)$ converges for $x \in D_p$. Then the
identity $\exp_p(x) = \cos_p(x) + i \sin_p(x)$ for $x \in D_p$ is
immediate from the identity holding as power series.

\prob{2}

\renewcommand{\O}{\mathcal{O}}

\subprob{a}

Let $\lambda \ce \abs{f(x_1)/f'(x_1)^2} < 1$. We first show
inductively for $n \in \N$ that we can find $x_n \in \O$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\abs{f'(x_n)} = \abs{f'(x_1)}$,
\item $\abs{f(x_n)/f'(x_1)^2} \le \lambda^{2^{n-1}}$,
\item $\abs{x_{n+1} - x_n} \le \lambda^{2^{n-1}} \abs{f'(x_1)}$.
\end{enumerate}
We are given $x_1$, so we just need the inductive step:
\begin{itemize}
\item By (1) and the hypothesis $f'(x_1) \ne 0$ we know $f'(x_n) \ne
  0$. So we may define $x_{n+1} \ce x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)$.
\item By (1) and (2) we have $\abs{f(x_n)/f'(x_n)} \le
  \lambda^{2^{n-1}} \abs{f'(x_1)}$, proving (3), and since $\lambda <
  1$ it follows that $\abs{x_{n+1} - x_n} \le 1$, implying $x_{n+1}
  \in \O$.
\item If $f'(x) = \sum a_ix^i$ then
  \[
  f'(x) - f'(y) = \sum a_i(x^i - y^i) = (x-y)g(x,y)
  \]
  with $g \in \O[x,y]$, so for $x,y \in \O$ we have $\abs{f'(x)-f'(y)}
  \le \abs{x-y}$. In particular
  \[
  \abs{f'(x_{n+1}) - f'(x_n)} \le \abs{x_{n+1} - x_n} < \abs{f'(x_1)}
  = \abs{f'(x_n)},
  \]
  with the last inequality shown in the previous step, implying that
  $\abs{f'(x_{n+1})} = \abs{f'(x_n)} = \abs{f'(x_1)}$, proving (1).
\item Finally we have for some $a \in \O$
\[
f(x_{n+1}) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n) \f{-f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} +
a\f{f(x_n)^2}{f'(x_n)^2} \implies \abs{f(x_{n+1})} \le
\abs{\f{f(x_n)^2}{f'(x_1)^2}}
\]
This gives (2) inductively.
\end{itemize}

By (3) and Problem Set 2, Problem 4b, the sequence $(x_n)$ is
cauchy. Since $K$ is complete we can define $x \ce \lim x_n$. By (2)
and continuity of $f$ we see that $f(x) = 0$. By (3) we see that
$\abs{x - x_1} \le \abs{x_2 - x_1} = \abs{f(x_1)/f'(x_1)}$.

Suppose we had another $y \in \O$ such that $f(y) = 0$ and $\abs{y -
  x_1} \le \abs{f(x_1)/f'(x_1)}$. Let $z \ce x - y$. Then we also have
$\abs{x} \le \abs{f(x_1)/f'(x_1)}$, and hence for some $a \in \O$,
\[
f(y) = f(x+z) = f(x) + f'(x)z + az^2 \implies 0 = f'(x)z + az^2.
\]
If $z \ne 0$ then this implies
\[
f'(x) = -az \implies \abs{f'(x)} \le \abs{z} \le \abs{f(x_1)/f'(x_1)},
\]
contradicting our hypothesis. So $z = 0$, i.e. $x = y$, and hence $x$
is unique.

\subprob{b}

Assume $K$ is discretely valued for convenience, and let $\pi \in \O$
be a uniformiser. We first inductively find for $n \in \N$ polynomials
$g_n,h_n \in \O[t]$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g_n$ is monic,
\item $f \equiv g_nh_n \pmod{\pi^n}$,
\item $g_{n+1} \equiv g_n \pmod{\pi^n}$ and $h_{n+1} \equiv h_n
  \pmod{\pi^n}$,
\item $\deg(g_n) \le \deg(g_1)$ and $\deg(h_n) \le \deg(f) - \deg(g_1)$.
\end{enumerate}
Note we only care about $h_1 \pmod \pi$ so we may assume $h_1$ has
leading coefficient not divisible by $\pi$. Since $g_1$ is monic this
means we can assume the given $g_1,h_1$ satisfy (4). Thus we are given
$g_1,h_1$ so we just need the inductive step.

We want to choose some $u,v \in \O[t]$ and define $g_{n+1} \ce g_n +
\pi^nu$ and $h_{n+1} \ce h_n + \pi^nv$. Then
\[
f \equiv g_{n+1}h_{n+1} \pmod{\pi^{n+1}} \iff f - g_nh_n \equiv
\pi^n(g_nv + h_nu) \pmod{\pi^{n+1}}.
\]
By the inductive hypothesis we can write $f - g_nh_n = \pi^ni_n$ for
some $i_n \in \O[t]$, and then the previous condition is equivalent to
\[
i_n \equiv g_nv + h_nu \equiv g_1u + h_1v \pmod \pi.
\]

Since $g_1,h_1$ are relatively prime mod $\pi$, we may choose $a,b \in
\O[t]$ such that $ag_1 + bh_1 \equiv 1 \pmod \pi$. Since $g_1$ is
monic we can write $bi_n = wg_1 + u$ with $\deg(u) < \deg(g_1)$. Then
we have
\[
i_n \equiv (ag_1 + bh_1)i_n \equiv g_1(ai_n + h_1w) + h_1u \pmod \pi
\]
Observe (applying our inductive hypothesis (4)) that
\[
\deg(i_n) \le \max\{\deg(f), \deg(g_nh_n)\} \le \deg(f).
\]
This together with
\[
\deg(h_1u) \le \deg(h_1) + \deg(u) < \deg(h_1) + \deg(g) \le \deg(f)
\]
implies that we can choose $v \equiv ai_n + h_1w \pmod \pi$ with
$\deg(v) \le \deg(f) - \deg(g_1)$. Then $i_n \equiv g_1v + h_1u \pmod
\pi$, so if we define $g_{n+1} \ce g_n + \pi^nu$ and $h_{n+1} \ce h_n
+ \pi^nv$, (2) and (3) are satisfied by the argument above. And (1)
and (4) are satisfied because we have chosen $u,v$ with small enough
degree.

Now by (3) the coefficients of the sequeneces $(g_n),(h_n)$ are
cauchy, and by (4) the sequences have bounded degree, so by
completeness we can define $g \ce \lim g_n$ and $h \ce \lim h_n$. By
(3) again we know $g \equiv g_1 \pmod \pi$ and $h \equiv h_1 \pmod
\pi$. By (1) $g$ must be monic, and by (2) we have $f = gh
\pmod{\pi^n}$ for all $n \in \N$, and hence $f = gh$.
\end{itemize}

\prob{3}

Let $f(x) \ce x^3 - 3x + 4$, so $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluating $f$ at each element of $\F_7$ shows that $-3$ is the
  unique root of $f$ mod $7$. We have $f'(-3) \not\equiv 0 \pmod 7$ so
  by Hensel's lemma there is a unique root of $f$ in $\Z_p$ which is
  $-3$ mod $7$, and hence is the unique root of $f$ in $\Z_p$.
\item If $f$ had a root in $\Z_5$ then $f$ would have a root in
  $\F_5$. Evaluating $f$ at each element of $\F_5$ shows this is
  false.
\item If $f$ had a root in $\Z_5$ then $f$ would have a root in
  $\F_9$, which would reduce to a root in $\F_3$. For $x \in \F_3$ we
  have $f(x) = x + 1$, so the only root mod $3$ is $-1$. Hence only
  $2,5,8$ are possible roots in $\F_9$, and evaluating $f$ at each
  shows they are not.
\end{itemize}

\prob{4}

\subprob{a}

Let $x \in \Q_p^\times$. If $x^{p-1} = y^n$ then $(p-1) \cdot v_p(x) =
n \cdot v_p(y)$. Since $v_p(x) \in \Z$, if this is true for infinitely
many $n \in \N$ we must have $v_p(x) = 0$, i.e. $x \in
\Z_p^\times$. Conversely, suppose $x \in \Z_p^\times$. Let $\o x \in
\F_p$ be its reduction mod $p$. Then $\o x \ne 0$ so $\o x^{p-1} =
1$. Thus, for any $n \in \N$, the polynomial $t^n - x^{p-1}$ has a
root mod $p$; since its derivative $nt$ will not vanish for $(n,p) =
1$, since then $n$ is invertible in $\F_p$, it follows from Hensel's
lemma that $x^{p-1}$ has an $n$-th root for infinitely many $n$.

\subprob{b}

Let $\phi \c \Q_p \to \Q_p$ be a field automorphism. It's clear that
$\phi|_\Q = \id|_\Q$ since $\phi(1) = 1$. Since $\Q$ is dense in
$\Q_p$, we will be done if we can show $\phi$ must be continuous. If
$x \in \Q_p$ has an $n$-th root $y$, then $x = y^n \implies \phi(x) =
\phi(y)^n$. So it follows from (a) that $\phi(\Z_p^\times) \subseteq
\Z_p^\times$, and hence $\phi(p^n\Z_p^\times) \subseteq
\phi(p^n\Z_p^\times)$ for $n \in \Z$. This implies $\phi$ is
continuous at $0$, and hence continuous.
