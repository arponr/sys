    Infinity in *Infinite Jest* (so far)

There are a couple of endnotes in which Wallace refers to infinity
mathematically. As a (hopeful) mathematician these had all the
appearances to support my raft. What a deceptively disguised shark!
Some of the math to me seems completely incorrect, or at least
imprecise.

First consider note 35 (p. 994), which "presumably" concerns the
foundational work of Georg Cantor, "whose 1905-ish Diagonal Proof
demonstrated that there can be an infinity of things between any two
things no matter how close together the two things are". Not only is
there this (by now standard) unreliable/hesitant narration in the
notes, the explanation is just completely false. In fact the
diagonalization argument was invented to prove a fact stated in the
immediately preceding clause, that "some infinities [are] bigger than
other infinities"!

Now consider note 123 (pp. 1023--1024), in which Pemulis dictates to
Hal the use of the mean value theorem in calculating initial
megatonnages in Eschaton. Here we have one of these especially long
and conversational notes, with insults/jokes between Pemulis and Hal
weaved in. But, again, what's worse for me is that the math is a
farce: you can't "just skim the highest and lowest ratios off the
Eschaton records" and then compute a mean value; that's obviously
ridiculous!  And the mean value theorem does you no good here: it
gives you the existence of a point in a continuous interval where you
can compute the mean, but by itself doesn't tell you how to find that
elusive point.

I feel like I have to assume Wallace is playing games with me
here---he can't just be *wrong*, and anyway it's less interesting that
way---but what are these games for? My only guess is that invoking
precise infinities imprecisely is part of trying to express the real,
but more imprecise and sort of emotional, infinities in life which
other parts of the book seem to be pointing at. E.g. the Cantor note
is placed in the text during discussion of "the diagnate infinity of
infinities of choice and execution, mathematically uncontrolled but
humanly *contained*". This is being used to describe tennis, but
together with the mistaken explanation of Cantor's diagonalization, it
might be interpreted as describing our "mathematically uncontrolled"
human interactions with the infinite physical world (even when
restricted to a finite space), and other people in this world.
