\section{Introduction}

Financial innovation has been an extremely influential process in the
contemporary economy. On the surface, it seems like the phrase
``financial innovation'' might describe some philosophical ideal at
the intersection of democracy and capitalism. In reality, it refers to
the creation of new types of assets in the market. A notable example,
and the one we will focus on in this paper, is the introduction of
financial derivatives like stock options and weather derivatives. To
realise just how influential this has been, one needs only hear that
the total notional value of the derivatives contracts in the United
States is on the order of hundreds of trillions of dollars
\cite{occ-derivatives}.

Financial innovations evidently introduces a great deal of complexity
into the market. But what is the purpose of this complexity?  A
fundamental theorem in welfare economics, usually attributed to Arrow
and Debreu \cite{arrow-optimal, debreu-optimal, arrow-existence},
states that competitive equilibria exist and provide Pareto-optimal
resource allocation under certain assumptions on the market. While
this provides some rigorous justification for Adam Smith's ``invisible
hand'' of the market, it is imperative to understand how valid the
assumptions of this theorem are in the real economy. A principal
example of this is the work of Greenwald and Stiglitz
\cite{stiglitz-incomplete}, which demonstrates that in markets which
are incomplete or have imperfect information---in particular, real
markets!---this theorem does not hold, i.e., the conditions of the
Arrow-Debreu model are not satisfied practically.

This provides and important theoretical motivation for financial
innovation: creating assets enlarges the set of events on which one
can trade, making the market more complete. So the economic idea
pervading the massive expansion of the derivatives market is the
following. Financial innovation allows the real market to better
approximate a complete market, hence better approximate the
Arrow-Debreu model, hence better allocate resources. Of course this is
only a heuristic justification. It's certainly not clear that more
closely approximately satisfying assumptions of the Arrow-Debreu model
will result in closer approximations to the optimality result of the
theorem.

In any case, analysis of the recent financial crisis has shed light on
how derivatives have truly impacted the economy. That there were
unforeseen consquences of this financial innovation is highlighted by
the regulatory reform instituted in the United States by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection act. In this
paper we:
\begin{enumerate}
\item discuss the role of derivatives in the crisis and why reform of
  the derivatives market was necessary;
\item argue how this discussion calls into question how effective the
  strategy of completing the market through financial innovation is in
  establishing economic growth.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Derivatives by example}

We begin by discussing derivatives specifically in the context of the
United States economy during the crisis.

\subsection{The role of derivatives}

As stated above, financial innovation can most abstractly be viewed as
a mechanism to make the market more complete. But one can make a more
precise, rigorous economic justification for trading derivatives: it
creates the possibility for better risk sharing in the market. For
instance, a futures contract decides a selling price and future
delivery date for an asset to be traded. This allows both parties to
share the risk of the asset value increasing or decreasing before the
delivery date, rather than each of these possibilities providing
concentrated risk to one party. Equal risk sharing is a feature of
optimal resource allocation \cite{cochrane-asset}.

However, risk sharing has constituted only a small fraction of the use
of the derivatives market, perhaps unfortunately so. It seems fairly
obvious that the creation of new assets, especially as expansive a
range as derivatives provide, will inevitably lead to
speculation. That is, one can bet on derivatives not to hedge or share
risk, but to acquire more risk in a new asset. For evidence of this,
we observe that ``since the value of credit default swaps hit \$62
trillion in December 2007, while the maximum value of debt that might
conceivably be insured through these derivatives was \$5 trillion, it
was evident that massive speculation by banks and others was taking
place'' \cite{crotty-structural}.

Of course it is not simply that derivatives allow speculation which
contributed to the financial crisis. Rather, what is key is the
specific nature of derivatives, which are essentially higher-order
bets on underlying assets. This nature allows the value of a
derivative to be highly sensitive to small changes in the value of the
actual underlying asset. In other words, derivatives can provide
enormous leverage. Consequently, investment banks and insurance
companies were able to accumulate \emph{and hide} enormous leverage
and debt in assets via off-balance sheet derivatives. When hidden
leverages become excessive, losses can have catastrophic effects, in
extreme cases resulting in bankruptcy. The inability (of banks in
particular) to compensate for these incredible losses was a primary
root of the financial crisis and the need for government intervention
\cite{simkovic-leverage}.

\subsection{Policy response}

The policy response to the state of the derivatives market took the
form of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010. The essential response to the role of derivatives in hiding
leverage in the crisis was reform enforcing the transparency of
derivatives trading. A key aspect of the problems outlined above was
the ability to hide leverage \emph{opaquely}, off of the balance sheet
and outside of exchanges. Dodd-Frank proposed to alleviate this
problem by requiring more derivatives trading to go through
exchanges. This increased transparency would allow more stringent
regulation of excessive leverage and hence prevent the excessively
risky and unbacked trading that led to the crisis.

What we should take away from the crisis and the need for this
regulatory reform is that continual financial innovation doesn't
automatically improve welfare. While derivatives indeed create a more
complete market, the crisis illustrates that this is not enough for
stable economic growth. There is still a great deal of imperfect
information and over-speculation which can instead lead the market to
crisis. It seems that establishing regulatory institutions might be
more effective than the market alone in ensuring financial innovations
are used in a prudent and valuable manner.

\section{Derivatives in theory}

In light of the regulatory reform provoked in the United States, we
next ask for a more theoretical justification for regulation of the
derivatives market. I.e., we look to models to provide a consistent
explanation of the need of regulation to control financial innovation.

\subsection{Belief disagreements}

One useful model which begins to answer this question is given by
Simsek \cite{simsek-speculation}. The main idea is that if everybody
agreed about the value of financial assets, derivatives would
effectively serve their role in bettering risk sharing. In reality,
though, there are \emph{belief disagreements} about asset values. It
is precisely these disagreements which drive speculation. Simsek
measures risk by net worth variance, and decomposes this risk into two
components: uninsurable risk and speculative risk. The former is
variance that would exist without belief disagreements, and the latter
is variance due to belief disagreements. The model demonstrates that
financial innovation decreases average uninsurable risk, supporting
its role as a device for risk sharing, but increases average
speculative risk. Moreover, if there is a sufficient degree of
disagreement, this increase in speculative risk outweighs the decrease
in uninsurable risk.

Simsek's model opposes the established idea that more complete markets
should always be closer to optimal. Instead it indicates that adding
assets to the market can in fact increase average risk taken in the
market when one considers belief disagreements. As disagreements are
essentially due to market players' imperfect information and inability
to exactly model the market, this can be viewed in line with the
results of the Greenwald-Stiglitz model mentioned in \textsection
1. Moreover, this provides some rigorous explanation of the events of
the financial crisis discussed in \textsection 2. It was exactly the
fact that derivatives encouraged overly risky and opaque trading that
contributed to the crisis. We can attribute some of the belief
disagreements in the market to this opaqueness. Hence this model gives
some theoretical justification for the reforms stated above increasing
transparency (i.e., information symmetry) in the derivatives market.

\subsection{Systemic risk}

The second theoretical consideration we discuss is not an explicit
model. Rather, we observe that a consequence of making a market more
complete is that the market becomes more connected. That is, when new
assets are created, new pairs of players are able to trade. A positive
effect of this connectedness is the ability to share risk more
evenly. One expects negative effects as well however: ``As is well
known from network theory, a more highly connected system\ldots will
often be more vulnerable to shocks and systemic failure''
\cite{colander-models}. In the context of the financial crisis, this
might suggest why subprime loans and the collapse of the housing
bubble precipitated such a severe and widespread reaction in the
international economy. It is not clear that the regulatory reforms
discussed directly address this connectedness issue. Indeed it seems
more practical to mitigate the possibility of systemic risk, since as
noted already, connectedness is also a virtue.

\section{More fundamental evaluation}

We have now discussed the role of derivatives in the economy both
empirically and theoretically. In both cases we have argued that
financial innovation, with the goal of creating a more complete
market, should not be expected to automatically encourage stable
economic growth. In particular, policy reform in the United States
after the crisis as well as theoretical models suggest financial
innovation can instead encourage unwanted risky behaviour, and hence
requires institutional regulation.

This leads us, finally, to ask: even with regulation, how effective at
all is financial innovation in increasing true economic productivity
and wealth? Fundamentally, how attached \emph{at all} should we be to
the premise that a more complete market will augment competitive
capabilities and increase welfare? This is essentially the following
more basic point that Professor Unger has brought up in lecture: we
need to understand the relationship between finance and the real
productive economy. It's one thing to say derivatives can
theoretically facilitate risk sharing, and another to investigate
practically how derivatives can serve finance's ``main function of
providing investment funds for production'' \cite{unger-democracy}.

The concern is that financial innovation might cause increase
higher-order financial wealth, but not provide concrete growth in the
productive economy. This echoes the concerns raised by Markovits about
``snowball inequality'' \cite{markovits-snowball}. The idea is that
inequality engenders more inequality, and that even within the
framework of capitalism, this higher-order inequality is harmful to
the market as ``it does not so much spur invention and the creation of
new resources as drive up the prices of assets that already exist.''
One can imagine this same negative higher-order effect applying to
complex financial innovation.

Therefore, the questions raised about the derivatives market by the
crisis and the following policy form lead to more fundamental
questions about the utility of financial innovation and the current
conecption of the market economy. The initial idea that we should not
dogmatically pursue a pure complete market guides us to Unger's
broader idea that we should be implement a more imaginative,
experimental, and fluid market economy.
