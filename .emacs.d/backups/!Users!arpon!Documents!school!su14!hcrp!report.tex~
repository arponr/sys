Roughly speaking, \emph{topology} can be defined as the rigorous
mathematical study of shapes. In particular, topologists consider two
shapes equivalent if one can be continuously transformed (or deformed)
into the other, and then ask: what properties distinguish distinct
shapes?  On the other hand, \emph{algebra} is the mathematical subject
dealing with symbols and formulae. There's a general idea in
mathematics that continuous, geometric problems, like those in
topology, are much harder than algebraic problems. Thus,
\emph{algebraic topology} seeks to find algebraic properties that can
distinguish between shapes, i.e., machines which turn topological
problems into algebraic problems. In fact, this philosophy goes as far
back as Descartes! He introduced the $(x,y)$ coordinate system on the
plane so that we could do things like find the intersection of two
lines formulaically.

I am fascinated by the machines produced by algebraic topology, and
the rich theory surrounding these machines. This is why I have taken a
course in algebraic topology for each of the past four semesters. But
it is an incredibly deep subject and I still have a great deal more to
learn! My goal for this summer is to explore \emph{stable homotopy
theory}, a part of algebraic topology which is a focus of many leading
mathematicians' research these days. One of these mathematicians is
Jacob Lurie, who I will be working with this summer. Professor Lurie
has developed (and is still developing!)  groundbreaking mathematics
both within stable homotopy theory and by applying its ideas to other
areas of mathematics. While I will not be working on his research, I
am incredibly excited to be able to talk with somebody who has such
mastery over and insight on stable homotopy theory, and mathematics in
general.

Specifically, I will be investigating the relationship between certain
objects in stable homotopy theory called \emph{spectra} and certain
machines of algebraic topology called \emph{cohomology theories}.
Cohomology theories often arise out of very geometric concepts,
e.g. vector bundles and manifold cobordism, both of which are also of
immense importance in physics. But their connection to spectra allows
one to compute some of their properties in a very algebraic way via
stable homotopy theory. This not only provides more tools to study the
topological properties of shapes, but also provides a way to
effectively study the original geometric concepts with homotopy
theory. This is a very cool area of algebraic topology, the subject of
a lot of current research, and something I can't wait to begin
exploring.


I believe I am fully prepared for this project. I have been taking
graduate math classes every semester for the past two years, including
several in topology as mentioned earlier. Additionally, I engaged in a
similar type of research project (though on a different subject) two
summers ago as a PRISE participant, so I have a good idea of what the
research process will be like. The two intervening years have given me
a great deal more mathematical knowledge and maturity that will surely
make my experience this summer even more productive and rewarding.

Moreover, this project is an important step for both my short-term and
long-term academic goals. In the short term, I am currently planning
on writing my senior thesis about some topic in stable homotopy
theory. Thus, as my first serious foray into the subject, my project
this summer will at the very least provide the familiarity and
hands-on experience with the basic ideas of stable homotopy theory
needed to write my thesis. In the long term, I am planning on going to
graduate school in mathematics, and in particular want to focus on
algebraic topology. And in the even longer term, I hope to be a
professor and research mathematician. Thus my project also serves as an
important first experience in researching modern topology, preparing
me for graduate school and beyond.

I plan to devote 12 weeks to this research. The exact dates and
whether I will be able to spend all 12 weeks on campus will depend on
housing and finances. In any case, I plan to proceed in the following
steps:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item My first goal will be to get really comfortable with the basic
  ideas and objects of stable homotopy theory. This will involve
  spending about two weeks reading parts of \cite{mosher-tangora} and
  \cite{adams-loop}.
\item Next I will study a paper \cite{thom-unoriented} on the
  cohomology theory of unoriented cobordism. This will be my first
  example of studying a cohomology theory via spectra and stable
  homotopy theory, so I plan to spend one or two weeks to really
  understand the ideas used and computations done in the paper.
\item Then I will study an analogous computation about the cohomology
  theory of complex cobordism, using \cite{adams-stable} as a
  source. This will lead more generally to investigating a story about
  \emph{complex orientable cohomology theories} and \emph{formal group
    laws}. This is something Prof. Lurie is very well-versed in. I
  also plan on talking to Prof. Mike Hopkins about these topics.
\end{enumerate}
This is as far as I have planned. After studying these topics I will
surely have a much better idea about stable homotopy theory and
cohomology theories. My interests and discussions with Prof. Lurie at
that point will lead me to researching related topics. Throughout, I
plan on meeting with Prof. Lurie about once a
week\footnote{Prof. Lurie will be out for a few weeks during the
  summer, but I will maintain electronic communication, and hopefully
  will also have the opportunity to chat with Prof. Hopkins and some
  graduate students.} to discuss my ideas and questions.

As a mathematics project, the finances are relative simple. I will
need to pay for housing, travel, food, and a few books. For 12 weeks,
I expect housing to cost roughly \$3000, travel to cost around \$100,
food to cost roughly \$1000, and books to cost perhaps \$200. However,
these are just estimates so I instead ask for the standard wage
stipend. If I work 40 hours a week (a rather conservative, but
customary, estimate) for 12 weeks, this will amount to \$4320, which
should hopefully cover my expenses. To be honest, though, I feel that
50 work hours per week is more accurate, which would amount to a
\$5400 stipend. I have requested this larger grant because I believe
it better reflects and compensates how I will be spending my time, but
I understand that this may be asking for too much.

To conclude, I believe that my extensive preparation in coursework,
clear plan and goals, and academic aspirations demonstrate my
seriousness about this project and research in general, and therefore
the appropriateness for this project to receive this grant.
