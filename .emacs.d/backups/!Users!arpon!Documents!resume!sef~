keenan and arpon discuss politics and sartre while waiting at the
corner of dewolfe and another street. arpon discovers that keenan
doesn't know shit about that shit. levent strolls down to the
corner. he thinks he's cool as fuck, but the cab he ordered isn't
there, so that's probably false. he calls the cab guy, the coversation
is hard to parse. in the end it seems the cab is not coming. who's
cool now.

now we have three guys walking around harvard square in search of a
cab. luckily for them, a cab passes by.
