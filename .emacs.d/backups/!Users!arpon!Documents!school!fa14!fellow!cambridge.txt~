I would take Part III as an opportunity to broaden and solidify my
foundations in mathematics. My undergraduate experience has been
incredible: I could never have expected the prodigious amount of
beautiful mathematics or number of inspiring people I have come into
contact with here. But it's gone by so quickly, and finding certain
material and professors so inspiring has focused my interests
somewhat, centered around algebraic topology. Thus, I think in my next
year of studies it would be most worthwhile to step back and: (a)
build my familiarity with and intuition for various other subjects, in
particular physics and geometry, and (b) revisit and more thoroughly
understand essential basics in topology and algebra. Cambridge seems
like the perfect place to work towards these goals, firstly for its
range of faculty and course offering: courses like "Quantum Field
Theory" and "Applications of Differential Geometry to Physics" would
be ideal with respect to (a), and "Homological and Homotopical
Algebra" and "Homotopy Theory" with respect to (b). Secondly, and I
believe just as key, is that being in a completely different
environment (I mean both the Cambridge University v. Harvard
University departments of mathematics and Cambridge, UK v. Cambridge,
MA) with classmates from diverse mathematical backgrounds would be
intellectually and personally stimulating. Such a change in
environment would certainly encourage a creative and constructive
break in routine, and help to achieve the academic goals I set out
above. For these reasons I believe Part III would be a truly rewarding
and productive experience.

Independent reading: I spent Summer 2012 learning about Lie groups and
Lie algebras with Prof. Joe Harris; In Fall 2013, I did a reading
course on abstract homotopy theory with Dr. Emily Riehl, and
participated in a reading group on infinity-categories supervised by
Dr. Hiro Tanaka; I spent Summer 2014 learning bits of stable and
chromatic homotopy theory with Prof. Jacob Lurie; I am currently
working on a senior thesis under Prof. Lurie on equivariant elliptic
cohomology. Teaching: I was a course assistant for Topology I in Fall
2013 (for which I received a certificate of distinction in teaching)
and for Algebra II in Spring 2014; In Fall 2013, Spring 2014, and Fall
2014, I have taught topics such as the concept of infinity and graph
theory to younger students (ages 6--9) in the Math Circle. I have
placed in the top 200 of the Putnam Competition for the past two
years.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to be involved in mathematics for as long as possible. So I
plan on pursuing a PhD in mathematics and subsequently a
professorship. At the moment, I am most fascinated by algebraic
topology and homotopy theory, and in the future want to continue
working on understanding the extraordinary connections these subjects
create between various fields of mathematics. In particular, there are
numerous connections between algebraic topology and theoretical
physics which I am interested in understanding, e.g. work involving
topological quantum field theories and work towards giving geometric
descriptions of cohomology theories like elliptic cohomology and
topological modular forms via fields theories. Thus I would love to
take the theoretical physics courses offered in Part III, both to best
understand the motivation and intuition in these connections, and
because fundamental physics is in and of itself a fascinating
application of the language of mathematics. More generally, I think
taking the next year at Cambridge to expose myself to more physics and
geometry, as well as revisit the fundamentals of algebra and topology,
would be a perfect way to prepare myself to understand and research
these highly interconnected stories which I think make mathematics so
beautiful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

My first exposure to abstract algebra, in my first semester at
Harvard, radically shifted my perspective on mathematics: in place of
the haphazard set of computations and problem-solving techniques I saw
before college, I now see a language which through abstraction reveals
fundamental structures, and which can express fascinating stories
about these structures. So in my eyes, while retaining its precise
logic, mathematics has gained an aesthetic, which has driven me to
invest (with pleasure) so much of my time and energy into
understanding it. Relative to my peers at Harvard, who unfailingly
have excelled in international mathematics competitions or taken
college-level courses since entering high school, I found this
all-important aesthetic quite late. Nevertheless, I have thrived
alongside them over the past few years, which I believe evidences
significant aspects of my leadership capacity, namely my sedulousness
and independence. These qualities manifested themselves immediately in
my first year, as I managed to excel in the infamously fast-paced Math
55 through sheer curiosity and hours of work, inspired by both the
material and my classmates. And this drive and enthusiasm has not
faded: I spent my first summer at Harvard learning mathematics
independently (advised by a professor), which enabled me to take a
life-changing graduate course in algebraic topology the following
fall; I did an independent reading course the fall after that; and
last summer I again spent on (advised) independent reading, this time
leading to current work on my senior thesis.

Stemming from my experience as a relatively late bloomer is a strong
desire to teach mathematics in a way which exposes its qualities which
so motivate me. This begins simply in the innumerable mathematical
conversations that take place in my circle of friends, in which I
always strive to convey the story, motivation, and intuition
underlying my understanding. I have also tried to carry this
philosophy into more formal teaching settings, as a course assistant
for two upper-level undergraduate courses last year and as an
instructor for younger students (ages 6--9) in the Math Circle for the
past three semesters. I know from experience (on both ends) that
teaching mathematics effectively is difficult, but I am committed to
helping students find the inspiration in the subject which I have
found in my undergraduate coursework and independent reading.

I hope this commitment is a lifelong one: I plan on pursuing a PhD and
then professorship in mathematics. The Part III program at Cambridge,
with its diverse faculty and course offering in physics, geometry,
topology, and algebra, would provide an invaluable year to broaden and
solidify my foundations in mathematics, serving as an excellent
preparation for understanding, researching, and teaching the stories
in mathematics which I find the most engaging: those connecting an
array of subfields, revealing deep, universal ideas and structures of
mathematics. The experience would be integral in furthering my ability
to lead as a creative contributor to and effective teacher of the
increasingly interdisciplinary body of mathematics.
