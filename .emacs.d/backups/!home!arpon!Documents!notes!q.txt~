is there a general notion of closed immersion for ringed spaces? is
there actually a finiteness/coherence condition required for complex
analytic spaces?

    yes. just define X --> Y to be a closed immersion if on spaces
    on spaces |X| --> |Y| is a closed embedding and on sheaves O_X -->
    O_Y is an epimorphism. here's the point then: if X and Y are
    *both* schemes, then the correponding sheaf of ideals I is
    automatically quasicoherent; similarly if they're both complex
    analytic spaces then I is automatically coherent. but there's a
    separate question: suppose a priori i only know Y is a scheme
    (resp. complex analytic space). then we may have a closed
    immersion where X is not a scheme (resp. complex analytic
    space). it is then that i have to *check* that I is quasicoherent
    (resp. coherent).

unoriented bordism of X, i.e., bordism classes of maps M --> X from
compact manifolds, is given by MO-homology. what is MO-cohomology?


    3 june 2014, meeting with lurie

    one way to think about it: suppose X is a simplicial complex. then
    a cocycle is the data of an n-manifold for each vertex, a bordism
    between the vertices for each edge, and higher bordisms for higher
    simplices. a coboundary is: take the same data for the simplicial
    complex X x I, and then take the difference of the restrictions to
    the two faces.

    i haven't thought about why this is true, but it certainly
    restricts to the right thing for X a point. and since it's sort of
    like families of manifolds over X, it should pull back
    contravariantly as cohomology should.

fix a space G. then on any space X i get a sheaf of sets U |-->
Mor(U,G). what are the stalks of this sheaf? (more generally (taking Y
= X x G) I can consider the sheaf of sections of a map Y --> X.)

i am really interested in the case that G is a topological group. when
G is discrete then maps to G are locally constant so the stalks are
just G, but this certainly isn't the case for G non-discrete. the
reason i ask this is that I want to know, when i have an exact
sequence 1 --> H --> G --> G/H --> 1, whether the associated sequence
of sheaves is exact.

can one define (higher) sheaf cohomology for sheaves of nonabelian
groups? i see how to define the first cech group, which classifies
principal bundles. assuming they exist, do the higher groups classify
natural objects as well?

i want to say BH --> BG is a fibration because a homotopy of maps to
BG is just an isomorphism of G-bundles, and if you start out with an
H-bundle you always have an H-bundle. this certainly applies to
finding lifts from, say, CW-complexes, but is that enough to say its a
fibration of topological spaces? i guess this depends on what your
definition of a fibration is.
