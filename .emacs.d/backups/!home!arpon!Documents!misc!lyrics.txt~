oh dear child, i love ya,
no not like Lolita,
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya
i just want to be ya

oh dear, do ya hear me
oh dear, do ya see me
no you're way too busy
too busy being free
too busy being free

i watch you play in the grass
you flail around with such class
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass
i feel your innocence as i pass

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

dark dark night and cold cold flow
i'm still alone
i guess that's dope
stay on this boat

black black crow in white white snow
i miss you so
i guess that's dope
i'm drifting slow

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far between
stay in the current of time unseen

dark dark stars and cold cold moon
at the break of noon
i'm lost at truth
what's there to do

black black heart in white white dunes
regret accrued
i'm lost at truth
i'll float on through

on this river
on this black river
where orange lights are few and far between
stay in the current of time unseen
