\section{The big idea}

Many ``macroscopic'' objects we consider and study---e.g., society,
organisms, computers, and matter---are composed of a large number of
``microscopic'' units---e.g., people, organs, bits, and particles.
Emergence is the idea that simple structure at the microscopic level
can give rise to comparatively complex structure at the macroscopic
level. This notion arose already in our discussion of the brain and
mind. At the foundation of cognitive neuroscience and psychology is
the theory that the elaborate human conscious and mental experience
\textit{emerges} from only the physical operation of the nervous
system, which further relies only on the firing or non-firing of
neurons.

The first section further explored emergence and emergent
properties. In one activity, we were assigned random numbers such that
each of us could see the others' numbers but not our own. We were then
given the task to pair up, with the goal of pairing with the
individual with the highest number we could. From this simple goal
guiding individual interactions emerged an interesting macroscopic
outcome: each person paired with the indivdidual with the number
nearest to theirs. The activity simulated an emergent property of
people's mating behaviour in society: on average, people who mate with
one other are of similar attractiveness. The following activity made
this observation even more interesting. We were again assigned numbers
in the same manner, but now given the goal to pair up with the
individual with the number we believed would be nearest to our
own. With this guide for interaction, pairing became essentially
random, starkly different from the first activity. This demonstrates
that macroscopic emergent structure can change dramatically when the
microscopic structure is altered slightly, and moreover does not
depend at all in a straightforward manner on the microscopic
structure.

The final activity revealed an emergent property which is perhaps of
even more social significance. We were split into two groups and
alternatingly from each group we sat down, but were only allowed to
sit next to a member of the same group. Of course the two groups ended
up seated in a completely segregated manner. While the result in this
toy model is obvious and predictable, it provides a startlingly simple
explanation of segregation in society. Even a slight, seemingly
harmless preference for interacting with similar people at the
individual level may give rise to a segregated society, an emergent
structure which many would deem harmful. This in particular
exemplifies the power of emergence in translating individual
psychological tendencies to social psychological tendencies.

\section{The article}

In \textit{Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology}, Braitenburg
(1986) discusses emergence more in the context of consciousness and
cognition, as mentioned earlier. Several thought experiments are
suggested; in each, a very simply functioning machine, or
\textit{vehicle}, is described, and its hypothetical behaviour is then
analysed.

The simplest vehicle can move in precisely one direction and has
precisely one sensor (p. 3). The sensor causes the vehicle to
accelerate in warmer regions. Assuming that friction will cause random
perturbations in the vehicles movement, Braitenburg concludes that
because of its continuous and variable motion, the vehicle will seem
\textit{alive}---a restless organism which does not like high
temperature, but which is not intelligent enough to remain in colder
regions (p. 5). The most complex vehicle has four sensors connected in
various manners to two motors on opposite sides of the vehicle
(p. 12). These connections are such that the vehicle exhibits the
following behaviour.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vehicle turns away from high temperatures.
\item The vehicle accelerates towards light sources.
\item The vehicle settles in regions with high oxygen content, but may
  then drift away.
\item The vehicle settles in regions with large quanitites of organic
  matter, in a relatively permanent fashion.
\end{enumerate}
Note that we can characterise (1) as \textit{dislike}, (2) as
\textit{hatred} or \textit{aggression}, (3) as \textit{exploratory
  affinity}, and (4) as \textit{love}. Braitenburg describes this
behaviour as the vehicle's ``system of \textit{values}'' (p. 12).

Braitenburg's vehicles can help us think about the human mind's
emergence from the physical structure of the nervous system. Though
the described machines consist only of a few basic components, we see
that just these components are able to give rise to lifelike and even
quite complex behaviour in the world. This lends plausability to the
idea that discrete signals between the \textit{billions} of neurons in
the human body might produce such complex behaviour as we observe and
experience. These thought experiments also suggest the intriguing idea
that sophisticated enough machines might approximate the behaviour of
animals and humans. This furthermore brings up the question of whether
we would consider these machines, or ``artificial intelligences'', to
have minds, and if so, whether our notions of scientific psychology
could also apply there.
