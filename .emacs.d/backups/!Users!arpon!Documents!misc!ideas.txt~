i feel like i'm at the centre of so many crossroads, paradoxes...

the urge to be moral vs the arbitrariness of the axioms. everything
comes down to some silly physical/biological tendencies, which is not
satisfying at all; its objective, but still arbitrary. yet i still
feel slightly depressed walking through the tanger outlets, ironically
light tropical music playing, witnessing a bunch of wealthy americans
(like myself) spend money on ridiculous crap, while not giving a crap
about the rest of the world.

making things for myself (math) vs making things for the
world. related to the first point - do i owe something to humanity,
morally? even though its just some arbitrary event that i was born (a
joke played on me, according to childish gambino). i feel like i
should *want* to do things for others. like a second order want, when
it should be a first order.

trying to be really good at something vs trying lots of things.

the dream of being alone vs the fear of being alone. caring about
others / being cared about is such a burden. i feel so uncomfortable
doing certain things - dancing, piano, singing, even watching tv,
probably writing - when others are around. i dream of the cottage in
finland, next to a lake, like described in colorless tsukuru
tazaki. being alone and finding something inside myself. but then it
seems that growth really happens on collaborative adventures -
e.g. spencer of harmontown, the power of the icarly gang's and avatar
team's relationships on me (the childhood thing seems even more
powerful somehow).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

everybody is just playing games. they try to understand their rules
(axioms), and play. conflict is rule-contradiction; conflict
resolution is arbitrary, driven by society which is driven by biology.

are we playing, or are we the pieces being played? lack of
scale-invariance. cf. kafka's machine in the penal colony.
