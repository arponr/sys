stolen away from restful dream
took the light
feeling brave
could not say i improved much youth

when the climb it comes again
barrelback and i will tend
to give it all miles away

that ever take its hold
settlewith regard all that is called upon

nowto the lake where at last we go
i was not late i was there below
no they did wait at the fork at the road
with the trail it showed faded fall

and pressures left untold
elements of frost inches of ice and gauze

to recall i hear the wind blow
from the soul down to the morning
to recall i hear the wind blow

----------------------------------------------------------------------

someone here's alive, somewhere underneath
caught between a reeling
mirroring the beat
i no longer fish
in the years of the sleep
show no sense of holding
staring aimlessly

i wanna go south of the river
glacier slow in the heart of the winter
i wanna go south of the river
face it alone in the heart of the winter

this would celebrate
this would settle
there in on the stage
this is a mistake
damn the earth below
damn the earth removed
damp and clawing evening
bursting into june

from a moment i was caught
from teh corridor was saved
and the limit of a ?

i wanna go south of the river
face it alone in the heart of the winter
i wanna go south of the river
glacier slow in the heart of the winter

all ignited at the love cry ?
few became few became as gorious or unlocked
as the forest they had started living near
ever since ever since the farthest reching island we had banks and disappear

someone here's alive somewhere underneath
caught betewen the reeling
mirroring the beat
i no longer fish
in the years of before
show no sense of holding
there's no sense at all
i was someone else
i was something pure
pitting at the armour
peril at the door

i wanna go south of the river
face it alone in the heart of the winter
i wanna go south of the river
face it alone in the heart of the winter
