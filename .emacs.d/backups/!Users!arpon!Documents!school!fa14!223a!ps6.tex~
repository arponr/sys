\prob{1}

Recall any finite extension of $\F_p$ is of the form $\F_q$ with
$q=p^f$, with the multiplicative group $\F_q^\times$ generated by a
primitive $(q-1)$-st root of unity. It's clear then that $\F_q$
contains a primitive $m$-th root of unity $\o\zeta_m$ if and only if
$m \mid q-1$, Since $\F_p(\o\zeta_m)$ is the intersection of all
finite extensions containing $\o\zeta_m$, we must have
$\F_p(\o\zeta_m) \iso \F_q$ where $f$ is minimal such that $m \mid q -
1 = p^f - 1$.

Now, under the equivalence of categories of finite unramified
extensions of $\Q_p$ and finite extensions of $\F_p$, we know
$\F_p(\o\zeta_m)$ must correspond to $\Q_p(\zeta_m)$ where $\zeta_m$
is an $m$-th root of unity lifting $\o\zeta_m$. And since $\zeta_m$
lifts $\o\zeta_m$, we see that $\zeta_m$ must in fact be primitive. It
then follows from the equivalence and the previous paragraph that
$\Q_p(\zeta_m)$ is a cyclic extension of degree $f$ where $f$ is
minimal such that $m \mid q - 1 = p^f - 1$.

\prob{2}

Let $v_K$ be the normalized valuation on $K$ and $v_L$ the valuation
extending $v_K$ (so $\im(v_L) = (1/e)\Z$). Recall that for $x \in
L^\times$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{norm-valuation} \tag{$\dagger$}
  v_K(N_{L/K}(x)) = n \cdot v_L(x)
\end{equation}
where $n \ce [L:K]$.

\subprob{a}

We have a surjection $v_K \c K^\times \surj \Z$, so to prove
$K^\times/N_{L/K}(L^\times) \iso \Z/n$ it suffices to prove that
$v_K^{-1}(n\Z) = N_{L/K}(L^\times)$. By (\ref{norm-valuation}) we have
$v_K^{-1}(n\Z) \supseteq N_{L/K}(L^\times)$. For the converse, let
$\pi_K$ be a uniformizer in $K$. Then $v_K(N_{L/K}(\pi_K)) =
v_K(\pi_K^n) = n$. Since we have proved in lecture that
$N_{L/K}(\O_L^\times) = \O_K^\times$ for $L/K$ unramified, it follows
that $v_K^{-1}(n\Z) \subseteq N_{L/K}(L^\times)$.

\subprob{b}

If a uniformizer $\pi_K$ of $K$ is a norm $N_{L/K}(x)$, then
(\ref{norm-valuation}) implies that $v_L(x) = 1/n$, implying $e \ge n$
and hence $e = n$, so $L/K$ is totally ramified. Conversely if $L/K$
is totally ramified then there is an $x \in L^\times$ with $v_L(x) =
1/n$, so (\ref{norm-valuation}) implies that $v_K(N_{L/K}(x)) = 1$, so
$N_{L/K}(x)$ is a uniformizer in $K$.

\prob{3}

\subprob{a}

If $x \in \m_L^i$ then $gx \in \m_L^i$ for all $g \in G \ce
\Gal(L/K)$; since $L/K$ is Galois we then have
\[
N_{L/K}(1+x) = \prod_{g \in G} g(1+x) = \prod_{g \in G} (1 + gx)
\equiv 1 + \sum_{g \in G} gx \pmod{\m_L^{2i}}.
\]
Then the observation
\[
v_K(\sum_{g \in G} gx) = \frac{1}{e} v_L(\sum_{g \in G} gx) \ge
\frac{1}{e} v_L(x) = \frac{i}{e}
\]
proves the desired claim.

\subprob{b}

By (a) we know $N_{L/K}(U_L^{(1)}) \subseteq U_K^{(1)}$ so $N_{L/K}$
induces a morphism of exact sequences
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  1 \ar[r] & U_L^{(1)} \ar[r] \ar[d] & U_L \ar[r] \ar[d] & k_L^\times
  \ar[r] \ar[d] & 1 \\ 1 \ar[r] & U_K^{(1)} \ar[r] & U_K \ar[r] &
  k_K^\times \ar[r] & 1.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Now note that the Teichmuller lift maps $k_L^\times \to U_L$ and
$k_K^\times \to U_K$ (coming from Hensel's lemma) give splittings of
these sequences. Moreover, the splittings must commute with the
morphisms induced by $N_{L/K}$ since: the norm of an unramified root
of unity is an unramified root of unity, the unramified roots of unity
in $K$ are determined by $k_K$, and the Teichmuller lifts are uniquely
determined by their reduction in the residue fields (again by Hensel's
lemma). Therefore $N_{L/K} \c U_L \to U_K$ is of the form $\phi \times
\psi \c U_L^{(1)} \times k_L^\times \to U_K^{(1)} \times
k_K^\times$. It is then evident that $U_K^{(1)} \cap N_{L/K}(U_L) =
N_{L/K}(U_L^{(1)})$.

\prob{4}

\newcommand{\ab}{\mathrm{ab}}

Let $A \ce K^\times$ and $G \ce \Gal(K^\ab/K)$. Let $\phi \c A \to G$
be the local artin map. By local reciprocity, for each open
normal subgroup $N \subseteq G$ we have that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the induced map $\phi_N \c A/\phi^{-1}(N) \to G/N$ is an
  isomorphism;
\item if $L \ce (K^\ab)^N$ is the finite abelian extension of $K$
  corresponding to $N$, then $\phi^{-1}(N) = N_{L/K}(L^\times)$.
\end{itemize}
By Galois theory we know that if $N_1,N_2 \subseteq G$ correspond to
$L_1,L_2/K$ then $N_1N_2$ corresponds to $L_1 \cap L_2$. So to prove
the statement in the problem, it suffices to show for $N_1,N_2$ two
open normal subgroups of $G$ that $\phi^{-1}(N_1N_2) =
\phi^{-1}(N_1)\phi^{-1}(N_2)$. Certainly $\phi^{-1}(N_1N_2) \supseteq
\phi^{-1}(N_1)\phi^{-1}(N_2)$. And it's fairly easy to see we have the
sequence of identifications
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\phi^{-1}(N_1)\phi^{-1}(N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1)} & \iso
  \frac{\phi^{-1}(N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1) \cap \phi^{-1}(N_2)} =
  \frac{\phi^{-1}(N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1 \cap N_2)} =
  \phi_{N_1 \cap N_2}^{-1}\l( \frac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2} \r) \\ &\iso
  \phi_{N_1}^{-1}\l( \frac{N_1N_2}{N_1} \r) =
  \frac{\phi^{-1}(N_1N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1)}.
\end{align*}
But since $\phi^{-1}(N_1)$ has finite index in $A$, it follows that
\[
[\phi^{-1}(N_1N_2) : \phi^{-1}(N_1)\phi^{-1}(N_2)] =
\l[ \frac{\phi^{-1}(N_1N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1)} :
\frac{\phi^{-1}(N_1)\phi^{-1}(N_2)}{\phi^{-1}(N_1)} \r] = 1,
\]
proving the desired claim.
