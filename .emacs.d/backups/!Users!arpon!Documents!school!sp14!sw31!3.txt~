global inequality today is mostly a result of between-country
differences

in fact within-country inequality hasn't fluctuated that much over at
all? but within-country inequality rising at unprecedented rates in
late 20th century [Thiel index, global rich list]

it's still better to be poor in a rich country than rich in a poor
country. top 5% in india is analogous to 10 to 15 thousand dollar
income in US. [holy shit]

country prosperity comes from slow stable growth over a long time. the
number is 2.6% growth, double every 25 years (generation).

very few countries have initiated *and sustained* rapid growth. not
many country have broken into OECD in the last 60 years.

conversely, turbulent volatile growth chracterises most poor
countries.

heterodoxy ("many recipes") required, "best fit" not "best
practice". no grand unified theory. Rodrik (2007, 2012). successful
cases (china, taiwan, south korea) often followed non-orthodox
path. no single story can accomodate this variety.

actually getting good institutions and implementing effective policy
is *really hard*.

institutions are often hybrid by-products of borrowed and existing
practices. (science, religion, capitalism (social welfare + industrial
and industrious revolutions + turning passions into interests +
uprading of financiers and creditors).

crises expost, exacerbate the fragility of these institutions.
