    The geometry of "Little Expressionless Animals"

David Foster Wallace's "Little Expressionless Animals" invents an
entangled mess of politics and emotions underlying the familiar, flat,
televised image of *Jeopardy!*; but it is a fundamentally human
mess. That is, it is precisely these politics and emotions which make
"Little Expressionless Animals" a story about real human characters,
instead of pure game-show-like entertainment. The invention of this
third dimension, a deeper geometry, of *Jeopardy!* insinuates an
insidious role of television- and image-culture in alienating people
from the real three-dimensional world, and obstructing a more complete
and fulfilling understanding of real 3D others and their real 3D
selves.

In this essay I want to justify two claims which flesh out this
insinuation, specifically in the character of Faye Goddard: (1) the
language of "Little Expressionless Animals" is constantly working to
distinguish between the geometry of reality and Faye's flat,
two-dimensional perceptions and interactions; and (2) this distinction
is at the root of Faye's failures in connecting with the world and the
people around her, in particular in finding, experiencing, and
understanding love.

Faye's character revolves around two central relationships, with her
mother, Dee, and with her partner, Julie. Let's first examine the
former. The first interaction between Faye and her mother in the
narrative takes place in the *Jeopardy!* offices, with Dee and the
show director, Janet, carrying out a sort of good-cop-bad-cop
interrogation of Faye regarding Julie's whereabouts. Wallace
introduces the scene by telling us that "The room is reflected in the
dark window", and during the interrogation Faye communicates with Dee
and Janet solely via this reflection: "Faye closes her eyes", "In the
window, Faye sees Dee's outline check its own watch", "Faye ... gives
... Janet ... the finger, in the window" (5--7). The description of
this interaction, in particular of Dee as an "it" and an "outline",
emphasizes Faye's flattened, two-dimensional perceptions and failure to
recognize her mother as a real human being existing outside of this
reflected image. This failure is displayed even more strikingly as the
scene continues:

> It is true that Faye can see her mother's bright-faint image in the
> window. Here is her mother's middle-aged face, the immaculately
> colored and styled red hair, the sore-looking wrinkles that
> triangulate around her mouth and nose, trap and accumulate base and
> makeup as the face moves through the day. Dee's eyes are smoke-red,
> supported by deep circles, pouches of dark blood. Dee is pretty,
> except for the circles. This year Faye has been able to see the dark
> bags just starting to budge out from beneath her own eyes ...
>
> Faye Goddard is twenty-six; her mother is fifty. (7)

Faye is again only capable of seeing a projected "image" of her
mother, which is somehow "bright-faint"---perhaps bright in its
grotesque physical details but faint in its portrayal of the human
underlying these details. The reductionism of Faye's image is
intensified by the final comparisons of appearance and age, which
suggest Faye only sees Dee as a faded, haunting image of her physical
future. The scene ends on this same note, as "[Dee] kisses [Faye]
gently. Their lips fit perfectly, Faye thinks suddenly. She shivers,
in the air-conditioning." (8)

But the disconnect between Faye and her mother revealed by these
two-dimensional images and flat perceptions is not an isolated or
inconsequential problem for Faye. In Faye's last, and this time
seemingly truthful, attempt at explaining her lesbian relationship
with Julie, she recounts the disturbing scene at the opening of the
story:

> "You and your mother happen to go to the movies ... It turns out a
> man in the theater behind you was playing with your mother's hair
> all through the movie. She breaks down on the sidewalk. Her husband
> has to come. She spends a year on antidepressants. Then she drinks.
>
> "Years later her husband, your stepfather, leaves her for a
> woman. .. Your mother gets obsessed ... She drinks ... You all work
> together in the same tiny but terrifyingly powerful industry. It's a
> tiny and sordid and claustrophobic little community, where no one
> can away from the nests they've fouled. You reel into confusion."
> (37--38)

Two facets of this explanation are particularly telling. The first is
how logically Faye is able to describe the utter collapse of her
mother's mental and emotional life. It is conveyed as a flat- and
formulaic-feeling "outline" of a story, leaving out entirely the years
of pain connecting this horrifying sexual event with the
divorce---years which seem crucial in shaping both Dee and Faye.

The second is that this explanation ends with Faye reeling into
"confusion", rather than "lesbianism" like in the others. This
highlights Faye's very need to explain her relationship with Julie:
Faye's apparent inability to understand her mother and her mother's
breakdown as human and real has left her confused about what love is
to her, and what she is looking for in the world and in other people.

This brings us to Faye's relationship with Julie, which I think can be
characterized by their respective roles in the inverted *Jeopardy!*
game format: Faye is on the side of the answers, the dry facts and
data, and Julie uncovers the questions that give these data context
and meaning, "something with the power to emote, evoke, induce,
cathart" (25). This idea is also expressed early in the story, in the
sort of geometric and dimensional language I am trying to expose, as
Faye and Julie tell each other about their pasts:

> "At first sometimes I [Julie] remember she'd give me a straightedge
> and a pencil. To amuse myself. I could amuse myself with the
> straightedge for hours."
>
> "I [Faye] always liked straightedges, too."
>
> "It makes worlds. I could make worlds out of lines. A sort of jagged
> magic."

The lines and straightedges work to again evoke a flatness and
(at-most-)two-dimensionality, which we might liken to walls of static
data. Here the significance lies in the difference between Faye's and
Julie's relationship with this flatness: Faye simply likes it, accepts
it at its surface, while Julie finds the geometry in these lines, the
worlds and "jagged" shapes they can form.

While Julie in this conversation communicates heartbreaking and
emotionally subtle memories about her relationship with her brother
and mother, Faye seems only able to offer flat, blunt responses: "'An
autistic brother simply cannot be decent company for somebody, no
matter how much you loved him, is all I mean,' Faye says, making an
angle in the wet sand with her toe" (11). This "angle" again
highlights the two-dimensional plane Faye traps herself in, which
seemingly prevents her from truly understanding Julie's emotions:

> "I can't believe you don't hate her," Faye says. ... "I can't
> believe you don't hate her."
>
> Julie throws a pebble. "Except I don't, Faye."

This exchange in particular suggests Faye's projection of her own
mother-issues onto Julie's, in essence a failure to recognize and
connect with Julie as a separate human being.

But the disconnect between Faye and Julie is displayed perhaps most
clearly in their final interaction, which again has "Faye look[ing]
for Julie's eyes in the mirror" (41). In this scene, Julie echoes two
key ideas recurring in the story, explaining that "Waves are what keep
oceans from just being very big puddles. Oceans are just their waves"
and asking "how could you ever hope to love what you can't grab onto"
(41--42). The first expresses that, though the ocean is something
completely "obvious" (41), we only truly recognize its existence in
its deviation from flat two-dimensionality, in the geometry of its
waves. This reflects the obviousness of other people, and the need to
recognize their full geometry to understand them, and in turn
understand oneself, as "A wave, breaking on a rock, give[s] up its
shape in a gesture that *expresses* that shape" (42). The second
expresses that one cannot physically grab onto something
two-dimensional, and hence cannot love the projected image of another
person. Again, one must recognize the geometry of the lover, "find the
holes in the lover's mask" (32).

And after all of this, as "Julie is looking at Faye" (42)---not in a
mirror or window, or at "the side of [her] face" (9, 12)---asking,
"See? ... See?", we are told that"Faye's eyes are open" (42), but it
is clear that they cannot see. All of this is lost on Faye. She can
react only with flat data---"It wasn't at the beach that Faye had
asked about the future"---and superficial concern---"You don't like my
face at rest?"  (42). This final reaction pinpoints Faye's inability
to recognize Julie as more than a flat image, explaining why "Julie
and Faye are exchanging anecodes and inclinations for the twentieth
straight month" (10) and "depended on the game, to even be" (41).
