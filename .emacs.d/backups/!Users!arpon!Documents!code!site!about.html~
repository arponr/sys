        <h2>What is this place?</h2>
        <p>Yo, I'm Arpon. I'm trying to understand things. Writing
          notes seems like the best way for me to attempt to do
          that. This is a place for me to keep these attempts.</p>

        <blockquote>It always turned out that understanding was all
          that mattered.</br>&mdash; A. Grothendieck</blockquote>

        <p>These days I'm an undergraduate at Harvard, for the most
          part trying to understand (parts of) math. So most of my
          notes will be about that. But I'm also interested in
          computer science (when there's enough math&hellip;), and I'm
          nearly always distracted by music, fiction, design, tennis,
          and running. So maybe there will be some random notes about
          those things, too.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you are <em>actually</em> reading this
          and <em>actually</em> want to contact me, that's crazy, but
          you can email me at arpon.raksit@gmail.com</p>
