Today I woke up in Finland, somewhere, in the grass. To be fair, I did
yesterday too, and the day before that, and . . . well, not to
infinity, as far as I know. I guess I don’t really know what I mean by
*today*, though, or *yesterday* or *the day before that* or
. . . . What I mean is, for some time now I have been falling asleep
and waking up in the grass, somewhere in Finland.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I arrived here in June on a red-eye. My plane landed at sunrise, my
eyes were red. With me I had:

- a pair of pants, on the darker end of khaki;
- a pair of boxers underneath;
- a short-sleeved t-shirt, grey and decorated with some made up
  emblem;
- a long-sleeved button-up shirt, made of faded blue flannel;
- a jacket, darker blue and sort of rugged---or maybe that’s just how
  it made me feel;
- a pair of sneakers, bright red;
- a pair of socks underneath;
- an old black backpack, containing my passport, my boarding pass,
  a collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami, a black leather
  notebook, and a couple of mechanical pencils.

The backpack was on my back, the jacket under my arm, and the
remaining items covered my body, so that I would not be considered
indecent. In particular, I left behind anything that could tell me the
time.

I planned to leave here at sunset, which should be sometime in August.

Perhaps this informs my confusion about *today* and *yesterday*, and
all those words that have to do with *days*.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I wasn’t hungry when I woke up today. To be fair, I wasn’t yesterday
either, or the day before that . . . and that same spiel about today
and yesterday and time and the sun of the Finnish summer.

So I just lay in the grass, letting myself wake up, one bone at a
time. The grass here is lush, green, soft, warm, beautiful, and so
on. It’s grass that you can lie in, where you can bathe in the
tireless summer sun, float down into a dreamless sleep and drift
somewhere, some place.

*Some place empty, but not cold or dark for even here the sun has not
set---does time even pass?---you are fixed here, and unsure if that or
anything else will ever change, so you wait, the sun overhead, and you
wait, and finally the sun has poured into you all that it could and
you wake up, in Finland, somewhere, slowly, one bone at a time.*
