\prob{1}

(Assume $n \ge 2$.) Observe that $U = \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(x_i) \subset
X$, so by the sheaf conditions we have an equaliser
diagram\footnote{My original argument went through stalks instead of
  the basic opens; discussion with Allen Yuan cleaned it up.}
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \O_X(U) \rar & \prod_i \O_X(D(x_i)) \arrow[shift left = .75ex]{r}
  \ar[shift right = .75ex]{r} & \prod_{i,j} \O_X(D(x_i) \cap D(x_j)).
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Since $R$ is a domain, we can view all objects in this diagram within
$\Frac(R) \simeq k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. Then since $\O_X(D(x_i)) =
R_{x_i}$ by definition, we get an identification $\O_X(U) \simeq
\bigcap_i R_{x_i}$. But if $i \ne j$ then
\[
f/x_i^n = g/x_j^m \implies x_j^mf = x_i^ng \implies f/x_i^n \in R
\]
since $R$ is a UFD. So $\bigcap_i R_{x_i} = R$, and therefore $\O_X(U)
\simeq R$. It follows that the inclusion $i : U \to X$ of schemes
induces an isomorphism on global sections. But then if $U$ were affine
$i$ would have to be an isomorphism, which obviously cannot be so
since $i$ is not even a bijection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{2}

Let $\phi : \Spec K \to X$ a morphism of schemes. As a space we know
$\Spec K = \{*\}$, and on the structure sheaf we have $\O_{\Spec K}(*)
\simeq \O_{\Spec K,*} \simeq K$. On the level of spaces, specifying
$\phi$ is equivalent to specifying $x := \phi(*)$. Next observe that
we have the commutative diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \O_X(U) \rar{\phi} \dar & \O_{\Spec K}(*) \dar{\simeq} \\ \O_x
  \rar{\phi} & \O_{\Spec K,*}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
for $U \ni x$ open, and of course $\phi : \O_X(U) \to \O_{\Spec
  K}(\emptyset) \simeq 0$ is uniquely determined when $U \not\ni
x$. Thus on the level of structure sheaves, specifying $\phi$ is
equivalent to specifying the (local) map on stalks $\O_x \to \O_{\Spec
  K,*}$. But since $\O_{\Spec K,*} \simeq K$ is a field, this is
equivalent to specifying a (non-zero) map $k(x) \to K$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{3}

Let $A := k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)$ and $\phi : \Spec A \to X$ a
morphism of $k$-schemes. Note that we have a bijection of sets
\[
\Spec A \simeq \{\p \in \Spec k[\epsilon] \mid \epsilon^2 \in \p \iff
\epsilon \in \p\} \simeq \{(\epsilon)\}
\]
since $(\epsilon) \in \Spec k[\epsilon]$ is maximal. Since $\Spec k
\simeq \{*\}$ also as a set, on the level of spaces, specifying $\phi$
is equivalent to specifying $x := \phi((\epsilon))$. By the argument
from problem 2, on the level of structure sheaves, specifying $\phi$
is equivalent to specifying the induced (local) map on stalks
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \O_x \rar{\phi} & A \\ k \uar \ar{ur}.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
So it now suffices to show that giving this map is equivalent to
condition that $x$ be rational over $k$ and giving an element of
$T_x$.

Assume we have a local map $\phi : \O_x \to A$. Then
$\phi^{-1}((\epsilon)) = \m_x$, so there is an induced isomorphism
$k(x) \simeq A/(\epsilon) \simeq k$ of $k$-algebras, whence $x$ must
be rational over $k$. Moreover by definition of $A$ there is an
induced map of $k$-algebras $\m_x/\m_x^2 \to A \to k$, giving an
element of $T_x$.

Conversely, assume $x$ is rational over $k$ and we have $v \in
T_x$. Let
\[
\pi : \O_x/\m_x^2 \to (\O_x/\m_x^2)/(\m_x/\m_x^2) \simeq \O_x/\m_x
\simeq k
\]
the quotient map. Then define $\psi : \O_x/\m_x^2 \to A$ by $\psi(f)
:= \pi(f) + v(f - \pi(f))\epsilon$, which is a priori just a map of
$k$-vector spaces. But if we have $f,g \in \O_x/\m_x^2$ and let $f_1
:= \pi(f)$, $f_2 := f - \pi(f)$, $g_1 := \pi(g)$ and $g_2 := g -
\pi(g)$, we get
\[
f_2g_2 = 0 \implies fg = (f_1+f_2)(g_1+g_2) = f_1g_1 + f_1g_2 + f_2g_1,
\]
which, together with $\epsilon^2 = 0$, give that in fact $\psi$ is a
map of $k$-algebras. Then we can define a map of $k$-algebras $\phi :
\O_x \to A$ as the composition of $\psi$ with the quotient $\O_x \to
\O_x/\m_x^2$.

It's evident that these two constructions are mutually inverse and
hence prove the claim.

\prob{4}

\subprob{a}

Let $f_i$ denote the induced map $f^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i$ and $g_i : U_i
\to f^{-1}(U_i)$ the inverse morphism to $f_i$ for each $i$. Since
\[
f|_{f^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)} = f_i|_{f^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)} =
f_j|_{f^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)} \implies g_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = g_j|_{U_i
  \cap U_j}
\]
for all $i,j$, we can glue the $g_i$ to obtain a morphism of schemes
$g : Y \to X$. Then $f_i \circ g_i = \id_{U_i}$ and $g_i \circ f_i =
\id_{f^{-1}(U_i)}$, so by uniqueness of glueing we obtain that $f
\circ g = \id_Y$ and $g \circ f = \id_X$, whence $f,g$ are inverse
isomorphisms.

\subprob{b}

The only if direction is obvious. So let $A := \Gamma(X,\O_X)$ and
assume we have $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in A$ which generate the unit ideal
such that $X_{f_i}$ is affine for each $i$. First observe that $X =
\bigcup_{i=1}^n X_{f_i}$, for
\[
\textstyle{x \in X - \bigcup_{i=1}^n X_{f_i} \implies
  (f_1)_x,\ldots,(f_n)_x \in \m_x \implies 1_x \in \m_x,}
\]
which is impossible.

Next, there is morphism of schemes $\phi : \Spec A \to X$ for which
the induced map
\[
A \simeq \Gamma(X, \O_X) \to \Gamma(\Spec A, \O_{\Spec A}) \simeq A
\]
is $\id_A$. We also have for $x \in \Spec A$ the commutative diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \Gamma(X, \O_X) \rar{\id_A} \dar & \Gamma(\Spec A, \O_{\Spec A})
  \dar \\ \O_{X,\phi(x)} \rar & \O_{\Spec A,x},
\end{tikzcd}
\]
with the bottom map a local morphism. So then $x \in (\Spec A)_{f_i} =
D(f_i) \iff \phi(x) \in X_{f_i}$, i.e., $\phi^{-1}(X_{f_i}) = D(f_i)$.

Let $1 \le i \le n$. From the above we have the commutative diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \Gamma(X, \O_X) \rar{\id_A} \dar & \Gamma(\Spec A, \O_{\Spec A})
  \dar \\ \Gamma(X_{f_i}, \O_X) \rar & \Gamma(D(f_i), \O_{\Spec A}).
\end{tikzcd}
\]
But $\Gamma(D(f_i), \O_{\Spec A}) \simeq A_{f_i}$ by definition and
$\Gamma(X_{f_i}, \O_X) \simeq A_{f_i}$ by Exercise 2.16d, with the
vertical maps the localisations. So by the universal property of
localisation the bottom map must be $\id_{A_{f_i}}$. By hypothesis
$X_{f_i}$ is affine, so we get that $\phi|_{D(f_i)}$ is an
isomorphism. Finally by (a) we have $\phi$ is an isomorphism $\Spec A
\simeq X$, so $X$ is affine.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\prob{5}

Let $\p \in \Spec A'$ homogenous, so $\p = \bigcap_{n \ge 0} \p \cap
A'_n$. Then since $\phi$ is a graded map,
\[
\textstyle{\phi^{-1}(\p) = \phi^{-1}(\bigcap_{n \ge 0} \p \cap A'_n) =
  \bigcap_{n \ge 0} \phi^{-1}(\p) \cap A_n},
\]
so $\phi^{-1}(\p)$ is homogenous as well. If furthermore $\p \notin
V_+(\phi(A_+))$, then $\phi^{-1}(\p) \not\supseteq A_+$, whence
$\phi^{-1}(\p) \in \Proj A$ by definition. Thus $^a\phi$ restricts to
a map $\Proj A' - V_+(\phi(A_+)) \to \Proj A$. If $\phi$ is
surjective, then since it is also graded we have $\phi(A_+) = A'_+$,
and hence $V_+(\phi(A_+)) = \emptyset$. Thus the above becomes a map
$\Proj A' \to \Proj A$.

\prob{6}

\renewcommand{\C}{\mathcal{C}}

The equivalency of (i) and (ii) is just the Yoneda lemma, and that
(ii) gives (iii) is tautological. We show there is an inverse
correspondence from (iii) to (i).

Suppose we have $f(T) : h_X(T) \to h_Y(T)$ functorial in $T$ for all
affine $S$-schemes $T$. Let $\{T_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a cover of $X$ by
open affine $S$-schemes and let $\theta_i : T_i \to X$ the inclusion
for $i \in I$. Let $i,j \in I$ and $T_{ij} \subseteq T_i \cap T_j$ any
open affine. Let $\theta_{ij} : T_{ij} \to X$ the inclusion. Then
functoriality of $f$ gives that
\[
f(T_i)(\theta_i) \circ \theta_{ij} = f(T_{ij})(\theta_{ij}) =
f(T_j)(\theta_j) \circ \theta_{ij}.
\]
Since $T_{ij}$ was arbitrary, it follows that the maps
$f(T_i)(\theta_i) : T_i \to Y$ are coherent and hence glue to a
morphism $\phi : X \to Y$ of $S$-schemes.

Finally note that, given the data of (ii), functoriality gives that
$f(T_i)(\theta_i) = f(X)(\id_X) \circ \theta_i$. So by the proof of
the Yoneda lemma (recall $\phi : X \to Y$ corresponds to
$f(X)(\id_X)$) the above correspondence (iii) to (i) is inverse to
that of (i) to (iii).
