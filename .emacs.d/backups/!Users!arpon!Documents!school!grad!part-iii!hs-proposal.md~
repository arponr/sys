title: Harvard-UK Fellowship Proposal
---

My time at Harvard has radically shifted my perspective on
mathematics: in place of the haphazard set of computations and
problem-solving techniques I saw before college, I now see a language
that reveals fundamental structures through abstraction, and can
express fascinating stories about these structures. This has in turn
completely transformed my relationship with mathematics: over the past
three years I have chosen to invest a basically absurd portion of my
time in understanding and teaching the subject. In hopes of
understanding far more, my central goal for the future is to sustain
and even amplify this absurdity as a researcher and teacher. As a
first step towards this goal, I am hoping to spend next year at
Cambridge University for Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, a
one-year masters program in mathematics. I am seeking the Harvard-UK
Fellowship to fund this experience.

Let me first explain how this radical shift, i.e. my devotion to
mathematics, came about. For most of high school I was banging away at
keyboards, convinced that programming was my vocation and singularly
engaged by my research in computationally modeling phenomena in
materials science. Yet at times I found myself slightly dissatisfied:
my models produced qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable
simulations, but why?  Trying to answer this question led me to learn
a bit of statistical mechanics and its underlying mathematics. I
distinctly remember finally understanding something about differential
equations on the back of a receipt during a materials science lecture,
and just jittering deliriously in my seat. Moments like this enkindled
further curiosity about pure mathematics, and I ended up working
through a book on the rigorous foundations of calculus as an
on-and-off side project during my senior year.

The resources and opportunities at Harvard allowed me to tie these
loose strands of curiosity into a knot of utter mathematical zeal at
my core. It all began when I decided to give the infamous Math 55 a go
in my first semester and, well, I just kept going. I was exhilarated
learning from and collaborating with brilliant, driven classmates; my
closest friendships came about not over coffee or at parties, but over
mathematics in a basement which we gladly called home. Before I knew
it, I was spending at least thirty hours per week thinking about math
(and probably another thirty hours per week dreaming about it).

My experience in Math 55 motivated me to seriously pursue mathematics.
The subsequent pursuit has consisted of sedulous, self-driven,
unimaginably rewarding work. It is this work that has inspired me to
go to graduate school in mathematics, and in particular informs my
purpose in taking Part III at Cambridge, so let me briefly say
something about it. I spent the summer after my freshman year learning
some mathematics with Prof. Joe Harris, during which I became familiar
with the subject of *topology*, the area of mathematics seeking to
make precise and then answer the question: how can we tell when are
two shapes are different? This allowed me to take a sequence of
graduate courses in my sophomore year on a subfield of topology known
as *algebraic topology*. The subject has fascinated me ever since,
chiefly because of the almost miraculous ways in which it links
diverse areas of mathematics---of course topology and algebra, but
also geometry and even physics. This past summer I immersed myself in
some of these miracles with guidance from Prof. Jacob Lurie, which has
allowed me to begin thinking about research questions in algebraic
topology in my present thesis work with Prof. Lurie. Indeed, I plan to
focus on the subject in my research as a PhD student and beyond.

However, I feel strongly that to truly understand the interactions
among topology, algebra, geometry, and physics which so animate me, I
must first broaden and solidify my foundations in mathematics. The
prodigious amount of beautiful mathematics and number of inspiring
people I have come into contact with at Harvard has been incredible,
but it's gone by so quickly, and finding certain material and
professors so inspiring has focused my mathematical interests squarely
on algebraic topology. As just one illustrative example, some of the
mathematics related to my thesis has fascinating interpretations in
physics. Indeed Edward Witten has stated that a certain object in
algebraic topology (which my thesis concerns) "is likely to shed some
light on what string theory really means." What this indicates to me
is that learning about string theory will give me another valuable
lens through which I may study this object, but unfortunately I simply
have not had enough time as an undergraduate to gain the requisite
background in physics.

This is why I am so excited about the opportunity to spend next year
at Cambridge for Part III. The diverse faculty and course offering of
Cambridge's math department makes it an ideal setting for stepping
back and slowing down from my whirlwind-like undergraduate
experience, allowing the mathematics I have learned and will learn to
really sink in, so that I may achieve this broadening and solidifying
before moving on to my PhD work. Courses like "Quantum Field Theory",
"String Theory", and "Applications of Differential Geometry to
Physics" will be ideal for building my familiarity with the pieces of
geometry and physics I have not been able to spend time on as an
undergraduate; and courses like "Homological and Homotopical Algebra"
and "Homotopy Theory" will be ideal for relearning and more thoroughly
understanding the basic motivating ideas and techniques of algebra and
topology. All in all, a year at Cambridge would furnish me with
invaluable resources for studying the stories in mathematics that I
find the most engaging: those connecting myriad ideas and revealing
deep, universal structures. It is in striving to understand these
stories that I seek the Harvard-UK Fellowship.
