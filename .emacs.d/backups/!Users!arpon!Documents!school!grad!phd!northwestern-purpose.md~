And of course it would be a real privilege to learn homotopy theory
from Professors Costello, Francis and Goerss. I would be thrilled to
continue working on stable and chromatic homotopy theory with
Prof. Goerss, as well as to delve into the other flavors and
applications of homotopy theory in Prof. Francis's work in manifold
topology and Prof. Costello's work in mathematical physics.
